"First time using Vivid Seats to get tickets. I bought tickets to a Tool concert from vivid seats and then read the reviews.... I was terrified that I would not receive my tickets. I bought my tickets 5 months before the show. My tickets were not released until 1 week before the show. I got an email the day they were supposed to get to me saying that they were sent but I would need different tickets to use at the venue. After setting up a ticket master account my tickets were sent to me. It was a nerve racking 5 months wait, but I did receive the tickets as promised!!!"
"I bought tickets 2 years ago and wanted great upfront seats to the Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Poison and Joan Jett stadium concert in Washington. I did pay extra for my seats which was two. But, it was sure worth it in the end. I was outfield in section five, row twenty five, and seats eleven and twelve. Since this concert is going to be a blowout, I recommend Vivid Seats and pay a little extra for great seats. The tickets came to me in the mail in just a few days!"
"Morgan Wallen tickets recently went on sale in my area. My daughter and I both waited online on Ticketmaster to get tickets. We were logged in early and still we could not get tickets. Every time we added them to our cart, it would say they had sold. We were crushed because we have wanted to see Morgan Wallen for so long!"
"Let me first say that I was very hesitant to purchase tickets from Vividseats, based on the overwhelmingly negative reviews. However, they had the best seats, at reasonable prices. So, I had no choice but to roll the dice and hope for the best. Let me just say that I was completely shocked when I received my tickets within five minutes of placing the order. The e-mails containing the instructions to accept/download the tickets were excellent. I had no trouble at all, and can now rest easy knowing I will be able to attend the Genesis concert at the end of this month, and that I will not have to deal with any of the issues other people have/didn't just waste a ton of money. It's worth noting that I am very tech-savy, and that may be te reason some people have had such issues with Vivid. These are electronic tickets/transfers, and you need to know what you are doing. Thanks, Vividseats, for pleasantly surprising me."
"The bad reviews got the best of my emotions. It was my first time using Vivid Seats & I didn't see the first email from the seller to release tickets to me. I had purchased 7 tickets for a football game & the first customer service rep did not clearly explain the process to me. Many of the cust. service responses seemed like canned responses, which scared me more. After being neurotic & stalking on LinkedIn, a Senior Vendor Relationship Manager made me feel better about the purchase. Then I did receive the electronic tickets, but they disappeared from my Apple Wallet the day of the event. They were retrievable from the seller's email, but the entire time leading up to the scanning of the tickets was extremely stressful."
"Vivid seats offers tickets to events, much like ticket masters etc. The issue is they don't back up what they sell. Despite a ""guarantee"". We went to the Rockzilla concert tonight and one of the bands didn't show as they had a positive covid test. The vendor said refunds would be available so we went out to get refunded and because we purchased our tickets through vivid seats, we couldn't get refunded. So we contacted vivid seats and because the entire show wasn't canceled we could not get refunded. And because we left the concert itself to get said refunds, we were not allowed back in. So we missed the rest of the show and couldn't get refunded like everyone else. Don't use this company. They are liars and thieves."
"After holding $1,200 of our money for 3 years, we arrived at Wrigley for Chris Stapleton concert to find we were directly behind a large black speaker with zero view of the stage. Submitted pictures and video of the disappointment to be told by Vivid that we did not have an obstructed view therefore no refund. I wish I could post the picture. What a joke of a company with zero interest in the customer experience. Vivid is a disgrace of a company. Highly recommend using alternative apps."
I never used Vivid seats before. They appeared to be a rip-off. The seats were obstructed and terribly expensive. My son wanted to go. All of a sudden I get a $22 charge from an insurance co. Allianz Event. I never asked for this and will dispute it with my credit card co.
"I have bought tickets through Vivid Seats for two different concerts. Overall, my experience was very positive. In one order, my tickets arrived via email within an hour or so. In my other order, my tickets didn't arrive until the night before the concert; that was a little nerve-wracking, but their customer service and chat support was great and they assured me they would monitor the situation."
Purchased tickets for a Guardians game for row HH. Received Row J as HH is handicapped accessible and J isn't As I'm Disabled. They Did not honor the 100% satisfaction guarantee. I would Not Recommend Vivid to my worst enemy. I got ripped off..
"I purchased tickets for a concert almost 3 years ago that was rescheduled 3 times, twice due to COVID which is understandable. When I contacted customer service about my inability to attend on the latest date, I was told I could not receive a refund and to resell them. Unfortunately, resale is not an option because Vivid does not guarantee you will receive the tickets until potentially the day of the event. How am I supposed to resell without tickets in-hand? Terrible service, unacceptable policies. Buyer beware."
"Consumer Affairs, please reconsider your recommendation that Vivid Seats is a legitimate company. There are numerous complaints here, on the Better Business Bureau, and social media on how this company scams people out of money. I purchased tickets to a concert in January 2022 and the company claimed the 3rd party seller sent me the tickets at the end of July. A thorough search of my email (junk and trash included) proved otherwise. Long story short, but I contacted the company numerous times over the course of several days and was outright lied to at least five times (I have screenshots). For example, they promised the tickets within one business day multiple times and never delivered. The concert is in less than 24 hours- I arranged for travel, a hotel, babysitter, taking off work, etc in addition to paying for the tickets in full and I still don’t have them in my possession. "
"Purchased tickets for concert in Resorts World Vegas. Was instructed to download an app called AXS and was told that it will have my tickets. Arrived at the venue, the AXS app allowed me to get in the door but when they were looking for the ticket, they couldn’t find it in my AXS app. Resorts world staff had to connect me to their wifi to access info on my app but no avail. At this time, the show has already started and we were refused entry. It was so frustrating coz we drove to Vegas for the show and secured our hotel rooms too, only to miss the show. "
Contacted customer support due not receiving the email for the ticket transfer. The female agent I spoke with insisted on I received the email and repeated stated information unrelated to my concern. She then continued to say she was attempting to help yet she stalled and was argumentative. When I asked for the supervisor she refused and caused me to be late for the game and the email as of 1:49 pm cst has still not have been received. The second representative stated I needed to create an account with another app using my email and then verify myself again after verifying my information several writhing 7 minutes on two separate calls. Not to mention that stated my order was verified and was showing. It was if they were loading my information in an alternate system.
"After purchasing an expensive set of tickets in 2020, finally concert rescheduled for 2022 - The day of the week and time changed, my entire situation has changed, and I can no longer attend. I was told for months I could sell, however couldn't sell because the tickets were not available to me. There is no way to sell them, and I was told that the venue hadn't released them but once released I would have the option to list for sale. I called the venue - they have nothing in my name, no tickets have been transferred or purchased although I paid for these 2 years ago. I cannot get Vivid Seats to tell me my seat numbers NOR will they refund me, all I have is the row number. I have called over and over, chatted online and all they do is read a script. The customer service team is ALL foreign and accent speaking very very hard to understand."
"We purchased a parking pass for the Billy Joel Concert in Pittsburgh using Vivid Seats. There are a lot of different parking lots and garages around PNC park so we were very careful to select only a surface lot and the one right next to the stadium so that one of the attendees (who has trouble walking) can get in and out reasonably well. After we purchased the ticket in that surface lot, they delivered us a ticket blocks away in a parking garage. The tickets in the lot were 3x higher than those in the garage, mainly because tailgating is not permitted in the parking garages, and it is further away. So we paid 3x the going rate for a parking pass than the going rate, because vivid seats did not verify what the seller was advertising and actually selling."
"We purchased tickets to a Chicago Cubs game in June. The event was for a game in August. We did not receive the tickets until the day of the game and only a couple hours before the game even started. We live over 3 hours away, so we needed to be able to plan for this event. Vivid Seats refused to refund our ticket money because they said the tickets were delivered in time. I have never had tickets delivered so close to the start of a game before. Completely unacceptable!"
Two years ago I purchased tickets to a concert and because of covid the concert was supposed to be postponed. I waited months because I understood the situation but when things opened back up I never received information regarding my tickets. I contacted Vivid Seats multiple times to check the status of the event and they have no answer for me. They listed my concert date as 2099 as a way not to refund me my money because they use the line you agreed to the terms and conditions when you purchased the tickets. I contacted the venue where the concert was supposed to be held and they notified me that they had already canceled that event and issued refunds to customers who purchased tickets through them. I explained this to vivid seats and they said they would look into it. 
"AVOID Vivid Seats if you want to go to anything! They tell you you've bought tickets then at first deliver WRONG tickets or try to anyway. Then they tell you they will ""make it right"" by ""upgrading"" your tickets and then NEVER send the new tickets! Oh, and they KEEP the money they basically stole from you and you are left with NO tickets and NO money! Great business practice if you can pull this off! How is this even legal??? Go to Stubhub or ANYPLACE but Vivid for your tickets! Unprofessional, uncooperative and unresponsive! SCAM!"
"I contacted Customer Service at Vivid Seats due to having COVID symptoms. They said I could try to sell on another site (not allowed to sell on theirs) but wouldn't give a recommendation. They also said I could ask the venue for help, which is also not where I bought my tickets. I said I'd be ok with just a credit, but they said they have no power or authority since it's just a secondary marketplace. It's just wild to not have policies to mitigate a global pandemic and/or actually care about your customers. I am so disappointed and will not be using them again. Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else."
"The lot that this site referred me to was NOT at Oracle Park as described on the Vivid Seats site so this was false advertising from the get go. It was a 25 minute walk away. It was also unmanned and there was no one to show my reservation to. There was a note that said the attendant was gone and provided a phone number. When called, the offsite lot attendant said that they don't work with vividseats and we could not park there or we would be towed. We had to find a parking spot on the street and were over a hour late to our venue, missing the main reason we went to this game. "
"If there was zero that would be the rating, bought Chili Peppers concert in October. My grandson is thirteen. It was going to be his 1st concert with the family, tickets were confirmed and my card was charged. So I get an email 3 days prior to the event July 31, stating the tickets are no longer available, they would try to get us other tickets, they started breaking up our party, ""Oh they had 2 tickets on this row. We will try to find more,"" this is how the conversation went the day of the concert, such a disappointment for my grandson who was looking forward to see one of his favorite bands. This company has no ethics, I cannot emphasize enough - do use them."
After receiving a copy of my review Vivid Seats promised a refund.
"It's a well established company and the website is pretty good, but their conduct is not honest. The ticket price for the Elton John concert at Gillette stadium in MA was shown around $70, but after fees and shenanigans it was $100 (big difference!) They did not mention clearly that it was not refundable if you need to cancel (even within an hour), and that parking was not included. Turns out that parking cost well over $100!! Such a big expense could be a deal breaker for many people, and should be clearly disclosed in advance."
Vivid Seats is a company hidden with hidden fees and a no chance to change or cancel seats once you found out you got scammed. When talking with the Vivid Seats Rep Jefry he couldn’t explain what the extra fees were. Basically just said the seats were the price they were. I ended up paying over $40 more for tickets I could of bought through the vendor themselves for cheaper. Either the seller made bank on their tickets or Vivid Seats needs to fix their crap. I will never buy from them again and I would encourage anyone to avoid them at all costs.
"I absolutely hate your company. My phone was stolen and someone used my account to buy tickets since my card info was saved on there and they used my phone to confirm the sale. I couldn’t cancel with you guys, even though the scammers bought insurance? THE CONCERT WAS IN A DIFFERENT STATE. I tried to dispute the charge with my bank after having to cancel my card, and I was DENIED because your company told my bank that I authorized the charge because it was authorized via email and text (THEY HAD MY PHONE). I tried to sell the tickets, BUT THEY NEVER ARRIVED FOR ME TO SELL THEM. You issued a refund for the ticket price, and gave me a $200 voucher for YOUR screw up. Yet today my card, a YEAR LATER is randomly charged TWICE for the same amount? I try to call and dispute and ask questions and can’t get through to an actual person. So so disappointed. Somebody needs to call me back and fix this so I can pay my mortgage that’s due in a week and a half."
"I created a Consumer Affairs account just to leave this review. I was so displeased with this service. Buy tickets to Pearl Jam concert, the money is withdrawn from the account, buy insurance for the tickets, then the next day receive an email that I must call Vivid Seats about the tickets. They say the tickets were already sold to someone else. Their ""customer service"" team was rude and unapologetic, offering no solutions or service whatsoever. What's more, the insurance I bought with the tickets they sold me, apparently without authorization, is ""not their problem"" so I have to deal with a 3rd party to get a refund for the insurance purchased, which I only bought because I was told I had just purchased concert tickets. I will never buy anything through Vivid Seats and would highly discourage anyone from using them for anything."
"I bought tickets. I paid for them. Their website listed my tickets as “confirmed” in big red letters on my account. But they never emailed the mobile tickets to me. On the day of the event I chatted online with customer service twice, both times the rep promised my tickets would be emailed before the show. The second person I talked to, “Christopher” said don’t worry the tickets will come. Just go even if they haven’t arrived. They will be emailed while you’re in line to get in. I’m sure you can see where this is headed. I went downtown. I paid for parking. I get to the venue. Still no tickets. "
"The artist added a new concert date locally after I had purchased tickets on Vivid Seats for one that was out of town. I have been trying for two months to get help with selling them. The event is not available on the list of concerts to choose from. I have spent more than two months trying to resolve this, with no fewer than six submittals on their site asking for help. I tried the Live Chat option, and was asked to provide the phone number for the account. All I got was an automated response saying that I wasn't in their system. I responded that they have it somewhere because they have been texting me on a regular basis since I bought the tickets. The same computer gave me the identical response. "
"I would not recommend Vivid Seats. We purchased tickets in November 2021 for a Red Sox game in July 2022 as a gift for our son. We received an email that we would get the tickets electronically in May. Once May came around we received another email that we wouldn't get them until 2 days before the game. Two days before the game we receive another email that we will not receive tickets until the day of the game. Our son and his friend flew to Boston to see this game, it was very stressful but knowing if they would have tickets in time. We called multiple times, got the same responses, they're guaranteed to arrive in time. We called at 3:30 the day of the game, got extremely upset with the representative and then at 4pm we finally received the tickets for their 7pm game. It was a very stressful experience and we will not be using them again."
"Never received my tickets. I ordered tickets to a baseball game and never received them. I spent $380, I feel like I was robbed. There was nothing I could do and their customer service didn't help me at all."
"Bought tickets, never received them. Called customer service multiple times and they said they'd ""reach out"" to the seller to resend them. Still haven't got them and customer service HUNG UP ON ME. 2 days until the event, and no tickets."
"Purchased a ticket for parking for Motley Crue in Chicago. The description stated it was parking specifically for this event. No times were indicated other than the confirmation email I received which stated it started 4:31 pm. Once I received the actual ticket, however, it was only valid from 3-8 pm. I immediately called because no concert ends at 8 pm. I was told they couldn’t do anything until I called Wrigley Field for confirmation of end time, which I did. Debra at Wrigley told me end time was 11 pm. So I called back & let them know. They put a request out to the seller. "
"I am writing this review because of my experiences for the last three hours. I ordered tickets from Vivid Seats a month ago, they took the money out of my account, but never sent me an order confirmation email. To try and receive this order confirmation email has been a joke. I can’t chat with anybody without my order number, I can’t get a hold of anyone on the phone line, and I sent an email. I am starting to think I got robbed for these tickets, and cannot seem to get a hold of a single human being in this company. This should not be this difficult, if someone didn’t receive an order confirmation they should be able to talk to a human and they should be able to get their order confirmation when they paid. I am not sure where to go forward from here, but this has been horrible and if I end up not actually getting robbed, I Will still never use this company again and will tell everyone to stay far away."
"I had an expensive ticket to the Garrison Keillor show at Red Rocks. Two days before I got an email that the location had changed to downtown Denver and I would receive a replacement ticket by email very shortly. Then the day of the show I received an email that my ticket was cancelled. There was a vague reference to covid 19, but no exact reason was given. Per pictures, I saw that they were not keeping people 6 ft. apart. The show was NOT sold out. The Keillor show said they were not aware of any cancellations. "
"I have no idea why there are so many positive reviews. If you want a true review of this company, please review their page on the Better Business Bureau website. Vivid Seats works with three party venders that send bad links to tickets then take poor action to resolve the issue. If you want to purchase tickets, try to find the primary institution that has the tickets as opposed to using Vivid Tickets which acts as an unnecessary middleman. Vivid Seats not only upcharges the customer a ridiculous amount for the tickets, they offer less seating options. I suggest trying to find tickets from a difference source. Compare prices. You will probably find another ticket vender that sells better tickets for less, but I will never use Vivid Seats again, and I suggest no one else does either."
Tickets for my favorite artist were just released and Vivid seats was marking up the tickets 3x their current price. Due to the ad it's the first thing to click on. No refund policy either. They are a bunch of scammers.
"I was looking at dates for a sporting event, clicked on sections available to see what seats were open, saw the ticket prices (which were far higher than they should have been) and decided to look elsewhere. Then an hour later I received a confirmation email of 4 tickets from vivid seats. $240. I didn't put any info in myself and when trying to explain this to a customer service rep he simply said we can't do anything. So I'm out 240 bucks and I can't even go to the game. Overpriced, and get your info without even getting to the checkout section. LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE."
"I bought tickets to a Willie Nelson concert in Nashville since I was going to be in the area for a convention. Less than an hour later I get an email informing that the date was moved to a date post my stay EVEN THOUGH THE WEBSITE STILL LISTED THE ORIGINAL DATE. I immediately called customer service and by miracle got a human. (I have called again multiple times and have not been able to get another human.) Customer service was useless, no refund given or no ability to resell ticket. Never again will I use this platform."
"Confirmation for tix seemed legit. Day of event, I get email saying tickets were coming through Ticketmaster & to wait for email link for transfer. Never came. Called 4 times, no assistance, no refund."
"I had purchased tickets for Paul McCartney concert in Winston Salem NC 5/21/22. I took my daughter, friend and 2 grands with me, all huge Beatles fans. We had a hotel 8 minutes away from stadium. Followed traffic signs into stadium, it took over 4 hrs to get there. Long story but Truist Stadium has had this problem with traffic and parking before as traffic police told us. But they continue to do these concerts and big events. We finally made it to the concert with less than 30 minutes left. Someone was in our seats and staff wouldn't help us. People in our seats wouldn't move. And security and ushers kept telling us we had to move from each small spot we could find for our 5 & 6 yr olds to see. They got to see bits of 4 songs before leaving."
"I purchased tickets over 2 years ago to see Chris Stapleton and Dwight Yokum at Glen Helen Amphitheater in Devore Ca. Here we are hours before the show and still after numerous calls, emails, and chats over the past several days and still no tickets. I purchased 5 tickets for myself and family members. Some have to travel several hours for the event. They keep saying the same thing….""Watch your email. Our staff is working on it."" Then I asked about the refund policy and the statement was made “if you can show proof you never received them before or DURING the show maybe then but our policy is no refunds.” "
"I purchased a concert ticket on 6/2/2022, received an email to accept my ticket, but then received an ""oops something went wrong"" error. I chatted with 10+ Vivid Seats customer service reps that advised that I use a different browser, try incognito mode, use different devices and click the link, but I got the same error everywhere. I tried from home and at work. I called customer service 2 times and they told me to do the same things which were unsuccessful. I asked for a refund and they said the fine print advises that they cannot provide a refund unless the concert is cancelled. So I paid for my ticket last week and can't get access to the ticket so I'm stuck and Vivid Seats is not helping. It looks like I'll lose money and miss the concert since they could not help. I WILL NOT BUY FROM VIVID SEATS again."
"I purchased tickets to a concert in a very specific section, as my friends were all attending. They sold me tickets to a completely different, far-away section. I have a receipt proving that I purchased tickets to section 229, but instead received tickets to section 227 (which is several sections apart on the seating map). I explained to them that this was unacceptable, as not being able to attend with my friends would essentially be equivalent to attending this concert on a completely different day. Per their own BUYER'S GUARANTEE, I am entitled a refund. They have consistent refused to do so. Vivid Seats is essentially a fraudulent business, as they sell a service that is completely different from the one their customers actually purchase."
I bought my tickets yesterday for my boyfriend’s birthday. As a good surprise. He would like to be on the floor section. They wouldn’t refund or change our section. Thank you for make our day miserable.
"I purchased tickets in February for a concert May 19th. I never received my tickets until 9:05pm (2 hours after the show started). Vivid Seats refuses to give a refund despite their ""100% buyer guarantee"" that tickets will arrive BEFORE event. I spent 1-1/2 hours on the phone with a representative the day of the event inquiring why I hadn't received my tickets and he advised that there was absolutely nothing he could do for me and that they would send a resolution 3-5 days AFTER THE CONCERT. I finally received the tickets 2 hours after the event started, which is pretty much useless. Called today to get a refund based on their guarantee that is stated on their website and was told that they would absolutely not give me a refund and there is nothing I can do about it. Buyer beware!! Do not purchase anything on vivid seats! They're a scam."
"I bought tickets to see the Eagles in Austin, TX from a third party. The week before the concert, I contacted their customer service to let them know that the tickets had not been transferred. The customer service rep told me they would contact the seller. Still no ticket transfer. I spoke to their customer service every day the week before the concert and was assured that they would resolve the problem and if the seller did not transfer the tickets in time, I would receive a full refund. They acknowledged that tickets were not transferred and when I asked for my refund, the customer service politely told me to ** off. They refused to refund my money. This must be illegal. Do NOT order tickets through Vivid Seats. They are a scam organization."
"I bought last minute tickets to go to a Warriors game and was super excited to go to my first playoff game. However as the event neared, my tickets were not delivered. I went on with the support team who assured me that they were going to be delivered. However by the time the event started I still had not been sent the tickets. I tried to get on with the customer experience department but it took over 30 mins to get in touch and by that point was already the second half. I was met with zero empathy and told there was nothing they could do and they refunded the ticket. I travelled more than an hour to get there for nothing. Please use a verified ticket site instead."
"This was my first time purchasing tickets from Vivid Seats, I will never do it again. They sold me tickets they didn't even have and when they said they would show up two days prior to the event. They did not, then it was one day prior to the event. They did not again... then the morning of the event, I called, this person said that he had spoken to his supervisor and that the tickets would arrive by 11 am and if they had not to call back. They did not show up again."
"I don't recommend buying from this company, they moved the event back by 8 months, and I won't even be living in the same city. And, who knows if it gets pushed back again. I requested a refund and they refused it saying the goods were sold as described. Well, being 8 months away from the day I intended is certainly not as described. I will never buy from this company again."
"I bought 3 tickets for a concert through Vivid Seats app. I received an email to transfer the purchased tickets to Ticketmaster. Once I performed the transfer only 1 ticket was there. Reached out to customer service and they had me go through multiple steps to verify I didn't have any more emails to accept tickets. Once I verified they told me they were reaching out to the sender and would send me a follow up email. After waiting 2 days, and only receiving a ""How was our service email?"" I reached out again, and was made to do the exact same steps and told the exact same thing. ""We will reach out to the seller regarding the 2 missing tickets and send a follow up email to you."" This time I waited almost a week and still only received another rate our service email. Upon reaching out for the 3rd time, I was finally told my last two tickets were dismissed because I hadn't gone through all the proper steps with the previous agents."
"I went to Vivid Seats and bought concert tickets on 5/18/22. They also recommended that I get a parking pass, which I did. After purchase of everything I saw that I had been charged for 2 parking spots, one for each concert ticket. I responded to the email receipt I got from the parking company and they told me I only needed one spot and to contact Vivid, the people who sold me 2 of them, to get a refund. I did and Vivid Identified the issue as an ""accidental"" purchase said all sales are final unless the concert is cancelled. These parking spaces were $150 each! I want a refund for the second spot but they refused. They have a history of hidden fees and this seems to be one of those things they get away with on a regular basis."
"I bought Rolling Stones tickets back in Feb of 2020, and of course like everything else during that time, the concert was postponed and I got a date for September of the 2021 for the reschedule. As the time for the concert approached, I being to realize that I had not received my tickets, even though they said they were delivered. Multiple calls and chats with customer service, and nothing was resolved. We were at the venue and could not get in because the tickets never showed up in my Ticketmaster account. Life happened and it took a while to being the refund process. "
"Do not purchase tickets from Vivid Seats!!! I paid $50+fees for parking at the Chase Center, which is reasonably priced for what you’d expect, however I found out after purchasing that this was actually for a small outdoor parking lot 1 mile from the venue! It was very misleading because the map pin was placed right next to the Chase center too. When I got to the parking lot, they were offering spaces for $20! I submitted a complaint to Vivid Seats support and they said they couldn’t do anything about it because they can only offer compensation for completely cancelled events. I guess if you are a scam artist then you should sell on Vivid Seats because there are no consequences for you as long as you are making them money! Stay away from this app."
"I purchased 2 tickets for playoff game 2, and was sent tickets for game 1. I sent multiple emails and chats, and called several times. Nobody could help me, and they insisted the game 1 tickets would work for game 2. The last customer service rep told me to go to game 2 with game 1 tickets, and if there was a problem to contact them! Never again Vivid."
"Purchased E-Tickets on 4/8/22 for event on 5/14/22 terms state delivered within minutes. The delivery was updated after purchase to 5/12/22. No delivery on 5/12 so they update to 5/13. No delivery on 5/13 so they updated to 5/14. They continue to pass the buck as it's the seller causing the delay and nothing they can do. These companies don't pay the seller until after the event. They used to pay the seller after delivery of tickets. This eliminates any motivation for the seller to transfer tickets in advance. On the flip side they charge you before tickets are delivered, take your funds, earn interest until after the event, update missed delivery dates and tell you SORRY nothing we can do until 2 hrs before the event!"
Outright stole money from me stating I placed an order a full hour before I even signed up to the website. One misclick and I'm on the line for an absurdly priced item. Will be issuing a chargeback as the chat and support team is just there to tell you ' there's nothing we can do.' Piss water.
"Avoid Vivid Seats, their claim that your purchase for tickets is 100% guaranteed is false. The day before my show they, along with the original owner, all of a sudden didn't have (or sold them to someone else) MY TICKETS. They offered other tickets NOT IN MY SAME SECTION AND NOT IN MY SAME ROW, YES, they were not in the center and not in row 6, but over on the far right of the venue and a few rows back. Don't want to seem petty but just beware you may NOT get the tickets you purchased."
"Purchased tickets for KY Derby (5/7/22) last November, tickets sent (5/3/22) are not what I purchased. Have been on the phone twice now with them, no followup as promised after first call. Still waiting after second call. Could be easily fixed as they have tickets on their website for sale that are comparable to those I ordered."
"Ordered tickets and found extra higher fees charged. I could have lived with that, but the problem was that even though I'd ordered these four months in advance, they didn't arrive in my email until the morning of the event. I was driving 700 miles to attend the event but wouldn't know until I got there. So, I thought this was a fluke. Just tried new seats again this year and got even worse. The event was rescheduled for a different date which I can't make. I asked Vivid Seats for a refund but they refused. As a result, I'm now forced to sue Vivid Seats. Worst company with which I've ever dealt. Their customer service is horrible."
"Stay away from this reseller. If something goes wrong, you will never get your money back. I purchased tickets for Imaging Dragons concert for $900. I received an email with the link to download my tickets. When I clicked on a link, I received a message that my tickets were already claimed by another email address. What??! I went back to Vivid and spent next 3 days trying to get to the bottom of this with Vivid initially trying to brush me off by promising to call in 24h with a resolution. There was no resolution. "
"Order **, we arrive at the venue only to find out the tickets were sent for the wrong date. We sit at the box office waiting for a customer representative to do something while we can hear the game starting up in the arena and we are missing it. Garbage service."
"So I purchased tickets to surprise my boys and they were so excited, they were not going to be the best seats but Golden State is my 10 year old's favorite team and he thought he would never be able to see them play in real life. So I picked seats on the visitor side and my boys were so excited they were jumping up and down and hollering when I surprised them. It took 2 chats to be told that the tickets would be sent, they recommended I just keep checking my email. Finally I received the email and the tickets were not the ones I purchased, they were all the way on the other side of the stadium. I called and spoke with a representative who looked into it and basically said they were comparable tickets and there was nothing that he could do. They were on the totally opposite side of the arena and the visibility was not the same as the purchased tickets. "
"I purchased tickets for a show in 2020 that has been rescheduled multiple times. I no longer live in the state of the show and it was rescheduled two years later. They will not offer a refund because the show is ""rescheduled."" I would recommend buying from more reputable sellers if possible. I would not consider 24 months to be ""rescheduled"" as I typically do not buy tickets two years out. They should have a refund policy for shows that are canceled beyond the purchaser's control but they do not."
"Vivid Seats is a trash website. They have almost no policies for not getting screwed by a third-party seller. Their policy is that the seller can hold on to your tickets until the absolute last minute, so if you have to travel at all for a concert, it's a really high risk website to use. Their only guarantee is that you'll get the tickets ""in time for the concert"" which actually means you could get the tickets at the last second while you're sitting at home hours or states away from the venue because they don't give you any information. Talking to their customer service has been a nightmare."
I used this site to order tickets for a concert which was later cancelled. Instead of giving the money back they only issued a refund to use on the Vivid Seats site. Thinking I was stuck with using the money with vivid seats or lose all the money I ordered tickets for a different concert at a lesser value. I should have a balance of at least $ 200 in my vivid seats account but it does not show up when I log in. Numerous attempts to contact anyone failed. I just want the remaining balance back. I don't want to order any more tickets through this site. Their customer service is unacceptable!!
"I bought 4 tickets for Strawberry Festival Beach Boys on March 4, I also I bought insurance to cancel if covid get bad, well Vivid company I try for 3 weeks try to reach somebody in the phone and email, they can found my account. I have to cancel. My wife get covid and fill claims (**) to the insurance. They ignoring to you. Awful experience. Do not waste your money with vivid. I still waiting for insurance refund."
Ordered tickets through this site Vivid Seats because it seemed as if that’s where the tickets were supposed to be purchased. I paid over $208 for 2 tickets. A month later a friend bought the same tickets for under $160. Same GM. Same everything except price. They are scalping tickets and making it seem like it’s a legit website.
Purchased tickets 2 weeks in advance and didn’t get tickets by promised delivery date. Tickets were delivered the day of event and the event was 11 hours from my home. So we didn’t get and didn’t get a refund.
I purchased tickets 4 months in advance for a specific section and the seller sent me tickets for a different section one day before the event. I am unable to sell the tickets because you are unable to list tickets for events less than 2 days away. VIVID SEATS did not rectify the situation and tried to say the tickets were an upgrade. The tickets are not the view I paid for plain and simple. Will not be using them in the future and would not recommend them as a reliable source for tickets as they may opt to send you different seats than what you paid for.
I purchased tickets for Chris Rock ($600). The seller never did a full transfer to my name and the venue would not honor the tickets. I also purchased tickets to Kevin Hart. I called the venue (different venue) and they have the same policy. To date the seller has not transferred the tickets to my name so they will also be invalid ($400). I have talked with customer service for hours and hours and they will not refund the money. I have emailed the CEO and two other VPs and no response. Their policy is the seller doesn’t have to put the tickets in your name WHICH MAKES THEM INVALID AT VENUES. TOTAL SCAM!!!!
On 2/13/20 I purchased tickets for an 8/11/20 for Rage Against The Machine at Madison Square Garden. It was understandable that the concert was rescheduled to 8/11/21 due to COVID. As the 2021 date approached I received another email stating that my tickets were changed again this time to 8/9/22 even though Vivid Seats was actively selling tickets to the 2021 show. Vivid refuses to issue a refund even though the claim that they have a 100% guarantee. Vivid is NOT trustworthy! Buyer beware!
"I purchased tickets for the New Edition concert through Vivid Seats. I looked up reviews on this site and was a little worried but decided to move forward anyway and was pleasantly surprised. I made sure to use a credit card with fraud protection and I was prepared to call customer service if my tickets weren't sent to me within 24 hours. Luckily, the tickets were sent to me within an hour and they came through Ticketmaster. No issues at all, would use them again."
I bought tickets for Vivid Seats for a VIP meet and greet. They only sent General admission tickets. I kept trying to get the meet and greet time. They told me I had to contact the venue but the venue didn’t answer any calls. I called vivid seat customer service several times and hours trying to find out times and applying their 100% guarantee process. They say anxiety free but it was anxiety ridden. They are fraudulent and their customer service sucks. They will keep you on hold all day acting like they will help and don’t. At this time I will contact my credit card company and make a dispute.
"I bought two tickets for a show in NYC. I booked a hotel and jade it a night away. I went to the venue an hour before the show started only to be told my tickets were invalid! I got sent to the box office and they scanned them again and said that those tickets were sold to another person and were invalid. I called Vivid Seats, was put on hold forever, I finally just went to the box office again and bought new tickets (thankfully they had some left), while I was still on hold. Someone finally came back on the line and I asked for my money back. She said that would not happen and that she would send me new tickets. "
"Purchased concert tickets through Vivid seats by mistake. Thought I was using Ticket master. Called customer service, and they were zero help. I was unable to get a refund or tickets early. It totally feels like I was scammed."
"This company is a total scam. I have contacted the BBB and the Attorney General's office. They will take your money, never deliver the tickets and then tell you that they are a 3rd party and can't help you. I purchased two tickets to a Knight Hawk game. I logged into my account and saw the tickets were supposedly delivered, however, when I checked my email, my spam and deletes, there was nothing. I called them (good luck with that, it took me 45 minutes to reach a person) and they stated that they would transfer the tickets to a different address. "
We ordered and paid for tickets for a NJ Devils hockey game that were never delivered to us. Then the customer service person had no idea how to help especially when we asked things that went off her script. Had to dispute with Visa to get our money back. They ignored us once the date had passed and were attempting to just keep the money. ABSOLUTE CROOKS. AVOID.
"I bought VIP tickets for a show on 01 Mar 2022 as a Christmas present for my partner. They were rather expensive and way over ticket price, but it was intended to be a VIP experience. Cut to the actual show- there ARE no VIP tickets. What we had instead was a seating upgrade to sit behind all the sound equipment at the back of the venue. The ticket sold advertised in-seat wait service (presumably from the bar since we needed to be 21 to buy the ticket), exclusive access to that area, and our own entrance. Needless to say, we did not get any of that. People who had regular standing room tickets were able to come sit in that area with us. We were not allowed to have any beverages because the seats were directly behind and slightly above the sound equipment. There was no VIP entrance. I purchased a VIP experience, and received the same thing if I’d just bought a regular $30 ticket. "
"I bought 4 tickets for a concert in Nashville 9 months before, and I am writing this 3 1/2 hours before the event and have not received my tickets, even though I have talked to customer service who assured me I would have them many days in a row. Never received them. I have filed a dispute with my credit card company, because Vivid Seats can't be trusted to tell the truth. Don't use them!!"
I ordered tickets in Nov for a concert in April as a Christmas present for my daughter. 2 weeks before the event the tickets still had not arrived. Email inquiries were met with delayed dates for delivery. 3 days before the event still no tickets. Repeated phone calls promised Mar 30. Then March 31 Then April 1. It is now the day of the concert just hours before it is to begin and still no tickets. There is a 3-hour drive for us to arrive at the venue. Don't buy tickets from these people.
"BUYER BEWARE! DO NOT purchase tickets through them if you actually want to attend the event. My tickets never arrived and their customer service kept telling me they had been transferred to me. I spoke with the MLB Ballpark App (where I was supposedly going to be able to access my tickets, but there were no tickets in my account), MLB.com and the baseball teams account manager and they all confirmed no tickets were in my account. Meanwhile, VividSeats customer service (which I was never able to actually speak to anyone and could only do live chat) kept telling me the tickets were sent and would have their seller ""retransfer"" them. A bogus process that resulted in no emails and no tickets. They said they could not refund me. TOTAL SCAM!"
"No Customer service. I also had fraudulent activity on my account that I suspect was internal to Vivid Seats. I recommend you purchase directly from Ticketmaster, which has good customer service and customer satisfaction."
"Was happy with initial purchase experience of 4 tickets to an NCAA hockey regional final. The tickets exhibited a game time of 12 pm which was crucial as I had to work that night. When I checked the scores from the first round matches I noted that the bracket showed the game time TBD and later that day showed a game time of 6:30 pm. When I checked back at Vivid Seats they still exhibited a game time of 12 pm and I was told by customer service that they only issue refunds for canceled events. While I was on chat with them for two hours arguing that they sold me a false bill of goods, they scrambled to change the event time to 6:30 pm and tried to tell me that I had purchased tickets to an event that was listed at that time. "
"I purchased Atlanta Braves tickets with the Chicago Cubs in 2019. Because of Covid the event was cancelled. I was only offered a credit for my purchase even though I has purchased insurance for the event. I then purchased spring training tickets as a Christmas gift for my son and daughter in law for March 26, 2022. The event was changed. The Atlanta Braves are playing elsewhere on that date. This is the team I am interested in seeing. "
"Somebody used my card and bought some tickets. I contact I immediately contacted customer service and ""LENLEN"" somebody who works for Vivid Seats said that couldn´t cancel the fraudulent order because that was the final price (the problem is that I did not purchase this). VIVID SEATS is not good to buy any OF YOUR TICKETS. I recommend TICKETMASTER 100%."
My experience...Overpriced and no refund. You can save $200 by going through Ticketmaster. You don’t know what seat you’ll be sitting in until your tickets arrive 2 days before the event. Definitely a ripoff in my opinion. My wife got cancer and was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and couldn’t make the event. Called 3 months ahead to try to get refund. Told them the situation and they didn’t care.
"I reached out to their customer service, over an an accidental purchase worth $600's that I didn't confirm, multiple times and never received a response. Even if nothing could be done about it, the very least they could do is respond. This is how they conduct their business. Beware."
I paid double for tickets and was promised they would be delivered two days before event. I had to chat with customer service twice and still not delivered until day of event. They would not give me a refund.
My tickets for an event were sent but I accidentally thought they were junk mail. I was assured that within 24 hours that I would have new tickets. The wait time I was put on hold was over a half hour. The customer service people lie and are not helpful. I was put on hold on and off for over an hour. They were rude and unhelpful. I asked for a supervisor and the call taker would not transfer me. I would never recommend this company to my worst enemy. They don't offer refunds or new tickets. STAY AWAY.
I purchased tickets for the 3/19/22 2pm Shen Yun performance at the Keller Auditorium in Portland OR from Vivid Seats on 2/26/22 for about $520. 2 tickets in box 8. The reseller was James **. When the tickets were scanned I was denied entrance and asked to go to the box office. There I was informed the tickets I purchased were canceled in 2020. The reseller knowingly sold canceled tickets through Vivid Seats. Vivid Seats obviously does not check validity of the tickets they sell. They are supposed to have a 100% guarantee of valid tickets. To see the show I was told I needed to buy new tickets and there were only 6 left. I purchased 2 new tickets at $320. I contacted my bank to fight the charge for a fraudulent sale and also contacted Vivid Seats Customer service. I got back an email from Vivid Seats that basically said I could fight the charge but probably would not win. Scare tactics?
"THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH in over 30 years of concert going. AVOID**AVOID** Lies, multiple broken promises on delivery date of tix, tickets issued literally 1 hour before drive to venue, and ISSUED ME TICKETS WORSE THAN I PAID FOR!! BAIT AND SWITCH!!! FRAUD!!!! NO TIME TO FIX IT - ON PURPOSE?!?! I bought 2x $600ea seats ($1500 with fees), was told in writing multiple times I was to be in Section CCC, Row 1-22 (front rows, at right of stage). Very last minute (literally) they defrauded me with tickets which were $300 seats ($274 on StubHub), way further back than I bought. I waited 2 years for this show, and they screwed me systematically. I was supposed to have my tix 4 days in advance, not 45 minutes before the show started."
"Absolutely no care about their customers. Won't refund, I’m not allowed to resell my tix on their site. They simply told me to sell my tix on social media and have a nice day. Will never use them again - beware of their lower prices. I’ve used them for every concert, sporting event for decades. Clearly you get what you pay for. If I could give them no stars I would."
"Purchased opening tickets SD Padres vs SF Giants 3/31. The game was canceled due to the MLB lockout. MLB scheduled opening day for 4/14 SD Padres vs Atlanta Braves. Vivid is calling it a rescheduled event? In my opinion, the event was canceled, the purchase was for SF Giants and SD Padres game, not SD Padres vs Braves. You should get what you paid for? Vivid needs to do a better job of the situation instead of looking out for their profit. They need to be more customer service understanding. Buyers beware!!!"
"I ordered tickets to a concert in Las Vegas using Vivid Seats. What ensued was a terrible experience in which I never received the tickets after hours upon hours of phone communication with Vivid Seats. As is typical with this sort of business, you are put on hold for a very long time every time you call in. I purchased the tickets, and was told they were ready for download, but when I went to the download page, the tickets were never there. Every time I spoke with one of their representatives, they assured me they would check with the seller and the tickets would be uploaded. When the tickets did not appear, I would call again and get this same response. This happened many times within 10 days of the concert up until an HOUR PRIOR TO THE SHOW. "
This was my first time using Vivid Seats for a ticket to the AAC basketball final. I was charged $51.43 for $20 parking that I could have paid for at the arena. This is a criminal Markup and I will not make this mistake again! This company is a scam!
"First time using Vivid Seats to get tickets. I bought tickets to a Tool concert from vivid seats and then read the reviews.... I was terrified that I would not receive my tickets. I bought my tickets 5 months before the show. My tickets were not released until 1 week before the show. I got an email the day they were supposed to get to me saying that they were sent but I would need different tickets to use at the venue. After setting up a ticket master account my tickets were sent to me. It was a nerve racking 5 months wait, but I did receive the tickets as promised!!!"
"No Support from Vivid When Needed. I purchased seats on Vivid for a preseason baseball game that was rescheduled. I accepted the tickets, which initially showed in my MLB Ballpark app with a message ""These tickets are not yet fully paid for"" but now the tickets disappeared entirely from the app. I contacted Vivid support, and they take the position that this is not their problem, and that I should now call the White Sox, and I am on my own with no further assistance from them."
"I purchased tickets for a spring training baseball game. Which was unfortunately cancelled. Trying to get a refund seems impossible. I've called, chatted with a robot and asked the credit card company to reverse the charges. By far the worst customer experience ever!"
I purchased tickets for event several months in advance. Ended up that I will not be able to attend due to health reasons. They told me that they cannot cancel tickets or refund even though event will happen in several months. No support whatsoever. The only help they told me that when I will get the tickets 3 days before event I can resell them though them. Waste of time. Please beware and never work with them.
I never received 3 tickets via email. I contacted and Vivid tried to do a ticket transfer 3 different times. Day of concert came and went resulting in a 900.00 loss to me. Be aware they also will not refund money. Stick with Ticketmaster.
"Stay away! They have terrible policies and will steal your money and waste your time without shame. It’s literally scamming people with overpriced tickets, bogus fees, and horrible customer “service”. Someone used my account to buy tickets and I received notification right away. Went to report the fraudulent purchase and ask for a refund. It took me almost an hour to reach a human rep, after taking forever asking questions, the only thing they kept saying was that all sales were final and that the only thing I could do was to resale through their platform (with no guarantee and for which they’ll charge you a fee obviously). How is such an unethical company allowed to do business in the US?"
"Vivid Seats is awful. I stumbled upon them and bought lawn tickets to a concert that's a few months from now at a venue I'd never been to before. The way Vivid Seats listed the tickets next to a venue map made it genuinely appear that there were different tickets for different sections of the lawn, with different prices (sometimes, depending on venue, this is the case with lawns where you can sit in special or reserved sections). The tickets even were labelled with different section names, and I ended up selecting more expensive tickets that said ""Row 1"" because I wanted to be as close to the stage as the lawn would allow."
"I purchased tickets to Anastasia December of 2020. The tickets were for June of 2021. Due to covid our tickets were canceled set for February 2021. Again they were canceled due to covid and set for February of 2022. Sadly, by then, my daughter that I had bought the tickets for, left the country on a church mission and was not able to use them. Another daughter and I were still excited to use them. We were told the tickets would be emailed that morning for us to download. It didn't happen. "
"Bought 4 tickets at vividseats.com to Nate Bargatze in SLC. Flew from Phoenix to attend event. Day before the event, received an email stating that there was a problem with getting my order fulfilled. Bottomline: NO TICKETS!!! Customer ""service"" was a joke, but it's clear that this company does not care about its customers or service. I'll never use them again and I would advise you to do yourself a huge favor and AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE!"
I bought tickets from this site. Ended up the tickets I bought were sold multiple times and when I called to discuss with Vivid customer service they gave me little to no assistance and told me there wasn't anything they could do. They can't certify the tickets being sold aren't real and don't want to help when this happens. Didn't get any kind of reimbursement or compensation and didn't get to go to the concert.
"Was sold tickets to a parking lot at Dolphins stadium. Got to the lot and there was nobody there to scan tickets. They said, ""You were sold a fake ticket."" Had to buy another one for 300 dollars. Called Vivid Seats to complain and filled out a denial of access form. It has been 3 months later and haven’t heard a word back from them and called and they said it is in their queue. 3 months for a fake ticket sold is no way to run a business."
"I ordered tickets through Groupon to a Bears game, I did not receive the email with my tickets from Vivid or any correspondance at all until just hours before the event. MY guests cancelled as there were no actual tickets on hand and therefore I was not able to go. They never replied to my repeated emails trying to inquire as to where my tickets were except the emails that said ""we are receiving higher than normal contact volumes."" It is unacceptable to not send tickets until a few hours before an event and to not respond or have any customer service whatsoever! I will never ever do business with either Vivid or Groupon ever again. I never got a refund of any kind and even when I disputed the charge with my credit card, their policy is no refunds. Well that is understable IF you receive tickets, not if you do not receive what you paid for until hours before the event."
Don’t use Vivid tickets. They said I got my Ticket. I surely did not and because it’s a third party sale they can’t help me get my ticket. What??? Don’t ever buy from them. Most companies give you the ticket as soon as you pay. This has been a nightmare and I don’t get to go to my event tomorrow. They told me they reached out to the seller but.. their hands are tied. What??
"3 chat bots, 2 phone calls, and 5 emails later, I am out $900 and still don't have tickets. On top of it, the show rescheduled and Ticketmaster is offering refunds but Vivid Seats does not. The answer from Vivid is ""Show up at venue on day of show, get your tickets and try to resell them then."""
I bought Billy Joel tickets 3 years ago. The concert has been rescheduled twice now. I no longer live in the state he is coming to so I asked for a refund or to transfer my tickets to a venue closer to my location. The answer was a hard NO & they wouldn’t let me escalate my issue to a manager. They are content to steal people's hard earned money & deliver zero services. Never again VIVID. NEVER AGAIN!
"Rated a 1 Star, because you can't leave a review with 0. I had 6 concerts in 2020, that were cancelled due to COVID. Parking was ordered through VIVID. VIVID sends emails for future events and each email shows I have a Credit Balance of 100.47... Tried to order upcoming event tickets through them, so I can use that Credit Balance... When checking out, there's no option to use those... So, I tried contacting VIVID and get stuck in a LOOP that you can't get out of... Chose the option to Live Chat. It's a BOT, that will not help you unless you answer their prompts appropriately... There is no option to talk to a live person at either # provided for VIVID... You go through all the prompts and get into the LOOP, then you're disconnected... How in the heck are some of these reviewers, talking to a live person?"
On January 20th I purchased 1 ticket to see Pretty Woman in Boston from Vivid Seats for $193 shortly before the start of the show. I received the confirmation that the purchase went through and that the ticket would be transferred to me by the seller and that I would receive an email with instructions on how to redeem the ticket. That email never came and the show was starting in about 45 minutes. I contacted customer service via chat to let them know. I gave them a second email to try to send the tickets to and nothing again was received. They gave me a unique Ticketmaster URL to try and that showed no tickets in my account for the show (I took screenshots).
"VividSeats must make too much money -- Because, judging by their reviews, they obviously do not care what their customers think of them. They have absolutely no customer service. They can care less how long it takes to pay you as a seller. You can't call anybody. Their CS lines direct you to a recording, the recording gives an email address which no one ever answers. If you have no problems, VividSeats works fine. If you need assistance or they owe you money... Shame on you - You did something wrong and they could care less.  "
Spent 350 on tickets and ins. for tickets a Bulls game for my daughter as gift. Two days before event the requirements to get in changed from having negative covid test to vaccination. They refused to give refund.
"I bought tickets in May of last year for a concert in Feb. Vivid Seats said my tickets were delivered but I never received an email so they said, ""No problem. We will contact seller and have them resend"". A month has gone by and I have no tickets and it is 3 days before concert. They keep telling me tough and that if I dispute the charge I will lose. They are jerks. No customer service just a bad attitude. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. It is a scam."
"Bought tickets to a Bruins game that was canceled due to covid which I understand is out of their hands but they rescheduled our game to a date me and the family will be out of town. They will not refund our money or even help us out with this. They give you the run around and refuse to help in any way shape or form. Their 100% buyer guarantee is ** and they do not stand behind their product. DO NOT USE THEIR SERVICES, you will deeply regret it. Now out $700."
I bought Packer playoff tickets. They didn't end up making it so I should have received a refund. They emailed me and told me I could get a 110% credit with them or my refund. I chose my refund. I called them and got a recorded service who told me an email address I had to contact them at and hung up on me. Before that I tried live chat and they kept telling me the invoice number they gave me was wrong. So I emailed them. I received a blocked message back.
"Bought 2 tix in Dec for 1/18/22 concert in Omaha along w/ airfare from SD only to arrive at venue & have to buy the same tix for additional $120 at box office because bar code was bogus. Was 2st told my ti. Were issued by TicketMaster (NOT), then told they were issued by A X S (NOT). I was on a 1st date, so very embarrassing. When attempting to resolve next day, was placed on hold 1 hr, then they disconnected. Called again. 1/21 and again disconnected."
"I bought tickets 2 years ago and wanted great upfront seats to the Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Poison and Joan Jett stadium concert in Washington. I did pay extra for my seats which was two. But, it was sure worth it in the end. I was outfield in section five, row twenty five, and seats eleven and twelve. Since this concert is going to be a blowout, I recommend Vivid Seats and pay a little extra for great seats. The tickets came to me in the mail in just a few days!"
"On 7/15/2021 I purchased Yankees Red Soc ticket at NY. The game was postponed due to Covid. I couldn't make the postponed time. Yankees Customer service told me to hang on to my tickets and exchange them for a game in 2022. When I went to do that the e-tickets were invalid. The original owner had the physical tickets and exchanged my tickets for another game. Contacted Vivid Seats. Response: ""Can't help you. We're not responsible. Sorry!.."" I read them their own ticket guarantee from their website. Didn't qualify. My paid-for tickets were stolen back by the original owner but Vivid Seats claimed no responsibility despite their phony guarantees. Wouldn't recommend them if tickets were half price."
"We bought playoff tickets for Dallas Cowboys. Vivid took our money, then canceled our tickets because their prices online for seats went up. We were told that they canceled and refunded our money and we could purchase them again at full price. Not our fault we purchased them in advance on their site and now because ticket prices went up they get to decide what to do with those tickets. Please stay away from this vivid site, we have never had an issue with them before but this is not fair. Their customer service didn’t even try to fix the problem. They just said that they had already canceled and sold our tickets, which was a lie because while on the phone our tickets were still available. Customer service guy wouldn’t let us talk with a supervisor. By the time we hung up to call back and try to talk with management he had already refunded our money."
"The basketball game tickets I purchased were rescheduled to a later date due to Covid concerns. It turned out I got sick with Covid around the date the game was rescheduled for. When I explained the situation and asked Vivid Seats for a refund, their customer service was less than helpful and didn't take the current global health crisis or health sensitivities around it into consideration. Since re-selling my ticket seemed to be the only option, I chose that route only to find that Vivid Seats charges to re-sell and only keeps the listing active for 24 hours. This was frustrating. I'll find another selling platform that prioritizes their customers rather than making a pretty penny from a scam. A piece of advice: do better."
"Horrible Horrible deceitful experience. Fees were never disclosed and before I knew it I was locked in while trying to understand pricing. Impossible to get to a live person. Finally reached a virtual chat and then another chat and was told all sales are final. Never Never use this service. I've used many other services with success, Vivid is horrible and deceitful."
"Do not purchase from this company! You will get the runaround. I purchased tickets for a friend as a Christmas gift and also purchased insurance just in case I needed a refund if I purchased the wrong tickets, in which I did- what they don’t tell you prior is that you literally have to have a life threatening situation, or a death in your family to be refunded. There’s absolutely no way Vivid or Alliance insurance are helping you out. Your only other option is to “sell your tickets” lol. Exactly who am I going to sell them to?? I’m not in that business- geesh. I will never use this company again or Alliance insurance- I was told -well it’s insurance so seriously like they were going to pay for my house if it burned down but they’re literally only insuring your inability to make it to the show and of course concert tickets, pretty funny stuff- I made a bad decision and have learned a lesson."
"Vivid seats extremely overcharged me by 5 times per ticket - for one single local college baseball game! My purchase for five seats totaled to $267.40. In the past I have bought tickets through Vivid Seats several times, not feeling overcharged or ripped off at these events. I have not attended this type of an event before and seeing what Vivid Seats offered this appeared to be a good deal. But this is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED, please see the following unacceptable and shameful experience we have gone through tonight."
"I purchased tickets on Vivid Seats. We were unable to attend the event. We listed the tickets and sold them. There was an issue with the tickets and we had to cancel the sale. The amount of the sale was $1,250.00. Vivid seats charged us $2,430 to cancel the sale. This company is a rip off at every turn. I encourage everyone to attempt to use their customer service before making a purchase! It cannot happen, they will not help you. "
"Website seemed good enough with adequate priced tickets and an easy interface. But the hidden fees are tacked on right before you check out and are never pointed out or highlighted leading to it virtually being invisible. The hidden fees added to four tickets that were about 200 dollars added a whopping 80 dollars to the final price. I talked to a representative and he was completely unhelpful and told me that they “outlined” the fees. I didn’t know outlining something meant putting it in tiny font in the corner. Awful website buy literally anywhere else, even if there’s fees somewhere else too if they at least properly “outline” them then it’s better than Vivid Seats."
"I purchased tickets, called to get refund since we didn’t use them. They said money back guarantee. But they ended up washing their hands off. They said it was not their problem. Thanks for nothing Vivid Seats."
We purchased tickets for an event that was advertised for my city but actually was happening in a different city and venue many hours away. I got endless runarounds from Vivid Seats customer service agents. One agent (Junio) lied and said he confirmed the event was real even though I could see from the venue website that it was not. Then he hung up the chat while I was still trying to arrange a refund. The next agent promised to contact me the following morning once they checked to see if the tickets were fake. That never happened. The third agent promised a refund but to get the refund I had to click on a link that took me on a loop right back to the chat with service agents who don't do refunds. AVOID at all costs. Purchase direct from the venue or reputable services.
"They sold me a ticket that do not exist. Customer Service says I was not scammed. End of story for them. Not for me. I also don't trust Consumer Affairs now, because you say that it is not possible to be scammed by Vivid Seats. Are you kidding me?"
"The two tickets they sent me for a concert last month were not accepted at the gate. I called Vivid Seats from the arena and they were of no help. When I filed a claim with them to get a refund, they declined as I didn't get the arena to provide a written statement saying they wouldn't honor my tickets. It would have been nice if they told me I needed that on the phone that night! I will never buy from them again. I am not a fan of StubHub but at least they backed me up the one time I had a problem with bad tickets."
"I attempted to purchase three tickets to an event several months out. I selected the seats but when I tried to checkout, Vivid's system informed me that they had already been purchased. So, I selected three alternative tickets and purchased those. A few weeks later I get my credit card statement that shows that I purchased 6 tickets. When I contacted Vivid, they had no option for live customer service, only email. That email went ignored for about a month until I finally reached a live chat agent, who blamed me for the error. ""John"" suggested that I resell the tickets that I never purchased on their website, so that Vivid can now collect a second commission for the same set of tickets. For $300 Vivid has lost my business for a lifetime as well as everyone I can reach. Beware of companies that have no concern for their customers."
"I have purchased tickets in the past using StubHub, Vivid Seats, Ticketmaster and others. Vivid Seats is by far the worst sales and customer service experience I have ever had. Paid $130 and never received my tickets. I have been on the phone over 2 hours with 5 customer services representatives over 2 days and received zero solutions. One representative even went quiet for over 3 minutes until I hung up the phone to avoid dealing with me further. Truly the worst experience of any company I have purchased any item from and had an issue with. I will never use Vivid Seats again and recommend that no one else does either."
"Do NOT use Vivid under any circumstances! I bought tickets to a football game, they sent the wrong tickets, I contacted Vivid immediately (within minutes) and they said they could not cancel the order and send me the correct tickets because they are merely a third party intermediary between buyer and seller. So much for their worthless ""100% Buyer Guarantee."" I recommend using a more reputable company like Ticketmaster."
"I bought tickets to a Chicago Bulls game and then had a conflict so I wanted to sell them. While it allowed me to list the tickets for sale, they wouldn't honor the sale. Told me I had to use a different site. Wait, I bought them on your site but I can't sell them on your site? Used Ticket Master and they sold in one day!"
"I purchased the ticket back in 10/4 for Vividseat.com and I was so excited to go BTS concert. TM released the ticket 10/5 but I bought this seat from Vivid so I can have better seat and price. I waited until 26 November but expected delivery date was changed to 27 then 28 then 29 then 30 and 1st Dec.. I called and I chatted with agents at least 20times and all of them told me exact same thing. ""You have to wait until seller release the ticket and you will get the ticket before the event."" I was so mad but I waited and waited... the day of concert 12/2 around 3pm I was chatting with some agent and she or he told me that seller doesn't have my ticket and he or she was offering different seat. When I ordered this ticket It was showing me this... We guarantee that your tickets will be within the zone or section listed or one comparable and that you will receive these tickets in time for the event or your money back."" "
"I bought my daughter Jingle Ball tickets for Christmas. Paid over $500 to see Doja Cat, Meghan the Stallion, and Jonas Brothers. Made it all the way to Atlanta to see a note on the door stating these acts had cancelled. Was told by the arena to contact the vendor for refunds. I contact Vivid Seats and they refused a refund because they substituted the “lineup”. I would’ve never paid this munch money to see who they substituted. I would’ve never went to this concert for free with who they substituted. I emailed with no repossessed, I called and got hung up on, and I chatted with two different “customer services reps” who refused to transfer me to a supervisor or the legal department. They would tell me to call or email. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
"I purchased two tickets back in November for a concert on 12/18. Along with all the hidden fees, etc, I was forward to a third party ticket holder App (DICE) where I was transferred my digital ticket. Fast forward to December 18th, the day of the concert. That morning, the tickets disappeared from my account. I contacted both DICE and VIVID SEATS. DICE told me my tickets were sent to me from a fraudulent account, which was set up through VIVID SEATS. When I contacted VIVID SEATS, they notified me they would get back to me. I have already cancelled my ride, as well as my hotel as it didn't look promising I'd make it to the concert."
"I cannot get this company to reply to my emails, pick up a phone and I sold 3k worth of tickets on their site. I also bought tickets and paid immediately. Ok I sold 2 sets of 3 tickets each to Olivia Rodrigo in New York City. For both shows I can immediately transfer the tickets through Ticketmaster to the people. I released the tickets from ticketmaster for ** and ** already to the buyers for these orders."
"We purchased tickets for Jason Alden and the transaction went through and then they were cancelled 15 mins later for some unknown reason. Tried to get them reinstated, an agent said they couldn’t. Ordered new tickets and they were never sent to our email as stated. I was on the phone with an agent at 8:40 pm, concert started at 9:00 pm advising her we still haven’t gotten our tickets. She quickly put me on a 5 min hold and said we should be getting them shortly, but never got them in time."
"We purchased 2 tickets worth over $400 in November for a December 19th show in NY. They didn't mail us the tickets till December 17th to Florida when we traveled to NY. IF we knew they were a 2nd market ticket-selling site, we would have never used them. Never again will we use their service and we will warn family and friends."
Purchased 4 Colorado Avalanche tickets for a game in Denver. Game postponed due to Covid. I could not fly back with family for rescheduled game. Would not offer any refund for face value or service charge. THEY DON'T CARE.
This is super unfortunate in the times we are living in. I purchased tickets this past Saturday. Monday took son to the dr. He was diagnosed with Covid. Vividseats response “sorry all purchases final”. This was a Christmas gift for my boys and as a single dad spent a lot of money now that I can’t get back. I will never use Vividseats again.
Live and learn..I purchased tickets to a college basketball game and inquired multiple times via emails as to why they were not immediately delivered..even up to the night before the event. We were always told they would be delivered electronically by the morning of the event Guaranteed!..Then the customer service became non-existent waiting more than an hour to never talk to a person and also typing with live chat for more than an hour before the chatbot would transfer me to a service rep...only to be informed the tickets were not available. No real vetting of their third party sellers..only a promise to return my money..Big Deal! If you're thinking about purchasing tickets through Vivid Seats...Think Again
"I purchased three tickets for the Old Dominion concert totaling almost $800. When my tickets were scanned, they turned out to be fraudulent. I called Vivid Seats and they were unable to solve the problem in a timely manner. I ended up buying three tickets from the venue to salvage the night. The refund is not given immediately and customer service is useless. I don't know when and even if my money will be refunded. I was scammed. Don't buy from them."
"Website charged me twice. They Stole $800 from me and told me that was the ""Terms and Conditions."" The site told me that the first transaction did not go through, so I bought different tickets. Then I was charged for both."
"I was recently looking for tickets and went through the process. I found tickets, put in credit card information, and hit the proceed button, only to have a pop-up appear saying that the tickets were already purchased. I figured I went past the 10 minute deadline so I went ahead and purchased a different set of tickets. Come to find out, they charged me for both sets of tickets. Now I'm stuck with an extra set, trying to resell them, and in all likelihood going to lose money."
"I purchased tickets to an NFL football game. Due to COVID-related travel issues, we could not attend. Was then informed by VIVID my tickets were not eligible for resale as they weren’t paper. They said use Ticketmaster, but of course the service fees were not refunded. I WOULD NEVER USE THIS SITE."
Purchased BTS concert tickets in October for concert in Nov. 27th. I started contacting them a week before the date by calling and online since there's no sign of tickets. They are all saying I will get tickets so there is no reason to worry-- Finally on the day of concert we still don't have tickets and I'm still receiving answers like 'you will get it thru email so no reason to worry'... We headed out without tickets trusting them and bought a parking spot and waited... keep contacting them... It's 10 minutes before the concert time and when I got them online they said 'we don't have tickets anymore'!!! How is this VIVID still a company after scamming so many people like this!!! If I had read their reviews ahead I wouldn't have bought the tickets from this scamming company. 
"Beware! I purchased a parking ticket for an NBA game which I paid $65 but I did not get a barcode on my ticket which the parking attendant would look for to enter. I said I was scammed! I tried to chat with a customer service but it was useless. She said they can't refund since I got the parking ticket. I have no problem if only they gave me a ticket with a barcode in it but I did NOT! I download all the apps, followed the instructions, open an account. And no barcode!"
"These folks are the worst. Their customer service is non-existent. They charge exorbitant fees and don't support their services. I had tickets to a cancelled Dan and Shay concert and trying to get a cash refund was impossible. Their ""Live Chat"" is actually a chat bot that takes all your info and then tells you to send an email. I sent the email and got no response. All that matters is keeping your money until they can over-charge you again."
"Zero stars, I purchased tickets on Sep for BTS concert on 11/27 730 pm at Inglewood CA, I got seats in section B close to stage, Tickets never arrived, called several times, wait hours, chat long time, they lied to me saying not to be worried the tickets will be released timely, I have to call daily even the day of the concert, I mentioned I will start driving, they say don’t worry, at the end they cancelled my tickets, And offered crappy seats in section 449 with terrible view. What really bother me is that I promise my daughter the tickets for the good grades, it was her first concert, and we drove all the way to the concert, we hear that the concert was starting, I felt basically forced to accept the crappy seats to at least my daughter could go in. This is beyond disappointment, I felt I was stolen, abused and seems all the people know how to operate and are allegiance to lie you. I don’t have words to really describe the miserable, abusive experience."
"I purchased two very expensive tickets through Vivid Seats ($586 each, plus $38.82 each in NJ sales tax plus $115.88 each in fees paid to Vivid Seats) to see Genesis as a birthday present for my husband. Genesis is a band my husband has been a major fan of his whole life and has never seen live. Upfront, the concert was neither postponed nor canceled due to COVID. My husband, however, suffered a recurrent brain tumor and the development of a prostate tumor, both of which require treatment that has caused profound fatigue, weakness, neuropathy, cognitive deficits and vastly increased immuno-compromise. Yes, I listed the tickets for sale via Vivid Seats. The listing expired, so I relisted."
"They are a freaking joke.... can't get ahold of anyone in cs because my show is too far out. Only people I can get ahold of is ticket sales and either they are all really dumb, or don't listen because they keep transferring me to an automated system that requires a confirmation number, however I never received one, but they sure could get it right enough to charge my cc... I have tried calling over and over and can't get anyone to help. Emailing is not any better....nor is their chat service.... I will NEVER buy from them again, I don't care how bad I want to go to any event. I will never work with such a poorly ran, company.... They should not be allowed to have a cs department because they don't give a crap about customers or their experiences. I don't see how they have stayed in business this long, but don't see how they could for the long run w/ the way they are ran. If you have not bought but are thinking DO NOT! RUN!!! No show is not worth this stress."
"I was not aware how bad this company was. They sent a confirmation with the wrong time of the event. Thanks to my friends who purchased their tickets through Ticketmaster we got to the event at the right time which was an HOUR before what their confirmation claimed. Then to my surprise, they did not send me the actual ticket so I was outside left waiting for an hour and thirty minutes in the cold on the phone talking to customer service waiting for my ticket to be sent to my email. The app was not helpful AT ALL. Then when I got my ticket finally got into the venue. I ""enjoyed"" ten minutes of the concert. The next day when I called them to ask for a refund, I talked to the rudest associate whom I suspect was also a bigot due to his change of tone when I told him my name and also his immediate aggressive attitude (really, this was bad). Avoid this company like the plague, it is failed, sketchy, and very unprofessional."
I paid $279 for one ticket and it never arrived. You have almost no recourse to rectify any problem with them. They make claims of guarantees which looks nice until you try to talk to them. Thieves!!!!
I bought tickets to two college basketball games at Madison Square Garden. I received notices by email that the tickets were delivered by email. I received the one set of tickets but the other email had an error and I did not get the tickets delivered despite all of the notices in the website saying I did. It is impossible to get through to anyone at the company. They tell you to email or use the Chat function and they will get back to you within 10-12 days. I used both at least 6 times over past month or so and absolutely no response. I am forced to report it to my credit card company as a $436 disputed charge. No way to run a business and I will never use them again. I think their site reviews are not real as I was unable to write a review on their site. Unfortunate but they are unreliable to the point of bordering on scam.
"A very horrible experience with @VividSeats. DO NOT buy tix from them. My event is today, and we planned for it but I still don’t have tickets and after an hour with customer services they told me — I may or may not get the tix two hours before the event. What a mess!"
"Morgan Wallen tickets recently went on sale in my area. My daughter and I both waited online on Ticketmaster to get tickets. We were logged in early and still we could not get tickets. Every time we added them to our cart, it would say they had sold. We were crushed because we have wanted to see Morgan Wallen for so long!"
"I am fuming! I paid over 1600 to have front row balcony tickets and they sent me row x and row y cheap seats. I specifically paid for seats where no one was in front and now I have 20 rows in front and no return money, no help. They have no person working to help! I will never use this service again. I am a nurse and can not afford to be ripped off."
Repeated emails go unanswered. Company does NOT have any access to speaking to ANYONE. Message after clicking number to proceed advise you to contact email and then call disconnects. The customer service isn't horrible...it's non existent.
I recently sold tickets on Vivid Seats. Once my tickets sold the website requested a PDF upload of my tickets. My tickets were mobile tickets and could not be saved as PDF. I called SEVERAL times to get help so that my buyers would receive their tickets. Calls continually dropped when I called customer service and no one answered my 15 emails. I then sold my tickets thru another platform and the transaction went very smoothly. After a month I received an email from vivid wanting to charge me if I canceled my sale with them. I asked to speak to a supervisor and the number they gave me left me on hold multiple times for 40 plus minutes. Never actually spoke to anyone. Thank God my credit card company was willing to dispute charges since I have thorough documentation of my attempts to contact this awful company.
"My 77 year old husband purchased 2 VIP tickets to a concert for over $400. When the tickets were delivered electronically, they were 2 General Admission Standing Room Only tickets. General Admission tickets were $90 each. I contacted Vividseats to get the tickets I paid for. Both my husband and I are unable to stand for long periods of time. I was told that I should have read the small print which gives them the right to raise ticket prices. They refused to provide us with the VIP tickets we paid for or make any adjustment."
I bought the wrong date for my Predators tickets and this has been a nightmare. I’m still trying to transfer these tickets over after losing $150! I will NEVER use Vivid Seats again and I will tell everyone not to use them. I’m also looking to report them to consumer groups. My complaints laid out:
I bought my seats a week early for a college football game. I called for four days straight and left messages Because I never received my tickets. Finally minutes before the game they contacted me and told me I already had the tickets. I did not. Never received any email or digital ticket prompt or anything. They then told me I had to download apps to get my tickets on my phone. I download it three different apps. Each with no tickets. We missed the game as it was already sold out. They then argued with me afterwards and told me I still have to pay for the tickets Even though I never received them because they’re from a third party And I couldn’t prove I didn’t receive them. Fortunately for me I documented all the apps and the Vivid Seat app progress via screenshot on my cell phone and had to turn them all over to my bank and I am currently waiting for a refund.
"WARNING: Vivid Seats Does NOT honor its CANCELLATION POLICY and Will KEEP your money if the show is CANCELLED as I experienced in New Jersey on 9/1/2021 when -- due to tornado warnings -- Alanis Morissette cancelled her outdoor show at the PNC Arts Center. Vivid Seats has pocketed my $1,627.07 and refuses to respond to emails. THINK AGAIN before using their service."
"No stars for this group - yet I had to provide a rating to submit the review, so here is a 1. I have used many resellers with success; however, I was purchasing a ticket for a sporting event in LA and their prices seemed reasonable. STAY CLEAR. The purchase was seamless, the email arrived quickly. The Link to the ticket was broken. Spent 1 hour on chat with two different agents as the first one was demeaning and could not figure out, but assured me with 1000% confidence in finding a solution. They needed to then ask for a 2nd email (which means you have two accounts with them and the event venue to finally get the ticket)."
Vivid is by far the worst company I’ve ever done business with. All I wanted to do was buy tickets to a college basketball game for my son’s birthday. I purchased the tickets but the transfer didn’t go through. I called Vivid Seats and after being on hold for almost 45 minutes they said they would contact the seller to re-issue me the tickets. This is never happened. I called over and over again waiting on hold for a ridiculous amount of time each time. I was told I could not cancel my order and could not get my money back. Every time I called I had to repeat myself over and over again. I was hung up on and treated rudely.
"Still on hold for 43 minutes, notified me action required on the end of the purchaser. This is what happens when AI takes over for humans. Welcome to the future, where robots suck and humans are unemployed."
I recently was looking for tickets on their website so I can take my son to a football game. I tried to purchase some tickets and a pop up said that these tickets were already sold. So I kept on my search for tickets. They charged me for the tickets anyways that said they were sold and when I finally got through to customer service they refused to help me or refund my money and the agent was completely rude. I am disputing the charge. Do not use this website. It's been a horrible experience dealing with them. Use StubHub or another ticket sales site. If I could I would give them zero stars.
"I purchased three tickets from Vivid Seats just recently. I was promised that they would be delivered before the event. I got an email from them telling me they had been. The truth was that they had not been delivered. After asking for help, all I got in response was that they would have to contact the seller. Because they don't really sell the tickets. I was told that even when they contacted the seller that there was no guarantee that I would receive them. I was told their guarantee does not cover that kind of thing because they're not selling the tickets. What a crock. If you're looking to sell or buy tickets from someone don't use vivid seats. You will be making a terrible mistake that you will regret. I regret losing my $280.50 from them."
"Purchased 3 Jamie Johnson tickets for $374 one month ahead of concert. Was told I would receive electronic tickets five days before concert date. When that did not happen I began trying to contact customer service which is impossible. Several live chats on the day of the concert promised my tickets would deliver ""just keep watching my email"". It never happened and the 100% Buyers Guarantee means nothing now. They reply to my emails weekly saying they are investigating my case, but no resolution almost two months after concert date. I wish I had seen all these one star reviews prior to buying. Tell a friend to beware of Vivid Seats."
I ordered tickets for Twenty One Pilots and when I got there the app wouldn't show barcode. So at TD Garden's box office they said I sent them to Marcella which I never would have ever done. They also said this app is not to be trusted. Left TD Garden bawling. I called. They tell me I did it. No refund. We were not the only ones in the box office with this issue. Now we need to bring this to small claims court. $333 later.
"Vivid Seats rescheduled my Rod Stewart concert no less than 4 times Aug.14, Aug 18, Aug 23 2021. Now back to Aug 23, 2022. They are telling me to wait another year for the concert, outrageous and a disgrace. I put in a dispute with my US ALLIANCE credit union who in turn enlisted CARD SERVICES to handle my dispute. Tickets were purchased on 6/9,2021 and I have been fighting for a refund of 196.56 since then. "
"I purchased 3 tickets 6 months ago to attend a concert today. Finally the tickets arrived this morning, but I received 2 sets of 2, in entirely different locations than what I ordered (not seated together). After spending hours on chats and emails, all I received is, ""we are attempting to reach the seller"". So now 1 of us is be unable to attend. After another hour waiting, I'm told that I'm being transferred to another agent who will provide me my options. I was transferred but the other agent never responded. So I have 1 person who is heartbroken and stuck with paying for a ticket that was never issued. Never again."
"A day before ATL Braves world Series Celebrations I was sold a parking spot and charged service fees for what was cancelled. Not to mention the part of my life I cannot get back on VIVID Seats Chat 2 hours before, several times the hour before and 10 min before event. I contiued to receive rest assured messages that there was a 100% quarentee that an e-transfer and the parking spot would be received by the event I NEVER WAS GIVEN SENT the Parking spot via the e-transfer as guaranteed. 20 Minutes after the start of the event 8:20 pm Incurred the additonal cost of $20 to park in the Delta Lot at Truist in Atlanta incurring cost and written assurance in a chat loop with vivid seats. I have filed a dispute and have not been reimbursed. In the lot I was told by the parking staff that all pre-sold seats where cancelled the day prior. So in hindsight I was sold a cancelled spot and charged fees for something that did NOT exisit to be sold."
"Bought tickets to Blackhawks vs Predators game over a month ago, my game is tomorrow and still don't have tickets. Only way to communicate with Vivid Seats is via email and responses are just childish and always the same - we are still working on it... Must have sent at least 15 emails so far. I am giving up, this company is a scam and please don't waste your time and money, because they just don't care, nor have qualified people to help."
"I bought specific seats in a specific section for a concert. Each row and section had a different price based on the proximity to the DJ. However, when I arrived, it was first come first serve. There were no assigned seats, and we were relegated to the back of the concert hall. This was complete and utter false advertising and misrepresentation by Vivid Seats. They played semantic games and didnt take any responsibility. They refused my refund request. Do not purchase tickets from this site. They are completely misleading and fraudulent sellers and cannot be trusted."
"This service should be shut down. The entire website seems legit, pretty easy to use, all the way up to getting your product. I paid over $200 for a parking pass to the Cowboys game. Ticket was supposed to be sent to me electronically. The process says I should have received an email with a link to transfer ticket. I never received the email. I attempted to use their chat to discuss the issue, Chat does not work, it's not a real service, all chat does is tell you to send an email. I sent an email multiple times. I finally got a response and it was clearly a canned response, they never read the particulars of my issue. There is no customer service, there is no way to contact the company. There is no 100% guarantee, it's all smoking mirrors. Do not use this site you will not get what you pay for."
"We had purchased George Strait concert in Jan. 20 for a concert in Aug. 2020. D/t Covid it was rescheduled for Aug. 14, 2021. Since my husband and I are not very knowledgeable about e mobile tickets and assessing them. The night before the concert we went over to the arena to asked an employee at the box office to help us. He could not assess them but said it shows they are our seats on his side. So the next night of the concert we went over to the arena and asked again for help. This time it did not show our tickets."
"I went on to the Vivid Seats' website and searched for tickets for an event. I found some that I wanted and I went through the buying process. When I clicked the ""Purchase"" button, I got a message stating that my tickets had been purchased by someone else in the meantime, and it kicked me back to the page where I could choose other seats. THERE WAS NO CONFIRMATION PAGE OR ANYTHING... just a pop up message stating the tickets I wanted were already purchased by someone else."
"Let me first say that I was very hesitant to purchase tickets from Vividseats, based on the overwhelmingly negative reviews. However, they had the best seats, at reasonable prices. So, I had no choice but to roll the dice and hope for the best. Let me just say that I was completely shocked when I received my tickets within five minutes of placing the order. The e-mails containing the instructions to accept/download the tickets were excellent. I had no trouble at all, and can now rest easy knowing I will be able to attend the Genesis concert at the end of this month, and that I will not have to deal with any of the issues other people have/didn't just waste a ton of money. It's worth noting that I am very tech-savy, and that may be te reason some people have had such issues with Vivid. These are electronic tickets/transfers, and you need to know what you are doing. Thanks, Vividseats, for pleasantly surprising me."
Buying tickets via this company is like throwing the money into a black hole. They are not transparent with all the fee cost upfront. The fees ended up cost as much as the tickets. Big scammer. Stay away from Vivid Seats site. Buy it directly from Ticketmaster.
"Tickets purchased with a ship date advertised as 10/23 for a game, eight hours away on 10/30. Tickets not shipped until 10/25. Original UPS Tracking had delivery as 10/27 which didn’t happen and when I checked again, they were scheduled to arrive less than 24 before the game (which is an 8 hour drive). Customer service said all they could to is initiate a reroute of the ticket to our Hotel. Come to find out, I have to trust that the person who took 2 days to send them after my purchase would have to be the one responsible enough to initiate the reroute. "
"Vivid Seats is a heartless company!!!! I recently attended a Rolling Stones concert in Charlotte. I went to purchase ONE parking space through their website. The quantity counter was stuck at 22. Thinking this was a glitch, I continued the purchase and was charged $1398.53 for parking!!! I've reached out to them repeatedly and they have claimed that they do not do the right thing and refund for human error. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!"
"This is the worst company there can be to buy tickets. Please if you don't want to waste your time and money look for a reliable company. At this time I made a claim with my bank for fraud in this place. I paid 2 tickets for a concert more than 800 dollars and They never came, I called several times and they treated me very badly, they told me to queue at the concert until my tickets arrived in the mail, this is stupid, my tickets never arrived and right now I'm waiting for the refund. I hope it's soon. I don't know how I didn't notice this scam, thieves"
"I have purchased tickets from many sites for concerts, shows, and games. This site was by far the most inconvenient. My delivery date has been changed 3 times and now I will receive my tickets hours before my event. It is very inconvenient now that if I would have needed to sell them, I now don't have the choice to do so. Will not be using them again."
"In January 2020, I bought 4 tickets to a show that was supposed to occur in May 2020. The event has been postponed twice, and is now supposed to occur in February 2022. I have tried multiple times to get a refund for the tickets I purchased. Trying to get hold of Vivid Seats to talk to someone is always next to impossible. I was on hold for approximately 45 minutes the first time I called. As expected, they have a no refund policy. I don't know how companies can get away with these policies.  "
"I bought some tickets twice because the website show an error: ""Tickets are not available at this time"", and it redirected me to the creation flow. I called the same day and wasn't able to connect, I also sent multiple emails without answer. In the end they didn't refunded my money because I had no evidence of the error. The website doesn't work well. Be careful when buying."
"I purchased tickets for a concert in Charlotte in late 2018 that was postponed twice due to COVID. I had downloaded the Vivid bar code (tickets). When I arrived at the venue, I was told that my tickets had been refunded and I needed to contact Vivid. I contacted them (after many tries and some web chats). They told be they would try to find me seats (as I am outside of the venue waiting, with my date). After 30 minutes, I said like to get I would like to get a refund. I was informed that I would need to fill out a form and return it for an investigation to begin. I am convinced that this company is a complete scam. I have spent $550.00 for these tickets. When I called them 4 days later they hung up on me."
I never received the two tickets I purchased for the Rolling Stones on October 9th in Nashville Tennessee. They refuse to refund my money. This company is fraudulent. Ticket #**. I drove 700 miles to get there and then had to purchase two extra tickets at the window.
"Thieves. Will never buy from here again. On top of charging you for a bunch of extra stuff, they don’t do refunds with the pathetic excuse they can’t because someone else sends tickets and they are just a mediator. Bunch of **. Besides you can’t even get a hold of them on the phone."
I purchased 4 tickets through Vivid Seats and I received tickets to a completely different event. I called customers service and they direct you to e-mail. I tried to live chat and it directs you to e-mail. I e-mailed and Vivid Seats stated they were looking into it and would follow up. It has been a week and no follow up. I reached out again today and the response is that they are still looking into it. My event is in two weeks and I still don't have the correct tickets.
"On 10/01/2021, my husband and I went to Montclair, NJ see Who’s Line Is It Anyway? which was brought in January 2020 but due to pandemic, it had been rescheduled several times. This was a my birthday gift from my husband that year. He paid close to $200 for it. We arrived at the revenue around 6:30 pm and was told that we can’t go in due to bag policy. I was carrying a bag that’s bigger than 4x7 and there’s no bag check option. "
"I have been given the runaround since 2019 by Vivid Seats (Vivid Cheats as I understand there is a reputation here). Our concert was re-scheduled several times. While waiting for the re-schedule date, they informed me that once a new date was scheduled I could get a refund. Now that there is a new date for my concert, they are saying I cannot get a refund, I can attend or re-sell my own tickets. In addition to this, I have since seen this performer at a venue of which I obviously purchased tickets outside of Vivid Cheats. This is nuts. I will be filing with my bank and the BBB next. This company should not be allowed to do business."
"The bad reviews got the best of my emotions. It was my first time using Vivid Seats & I didn't see the first email from the seller to release tickets to me. I had purchased 7 tickets for a football game & the first customer service rep did not clearly explain the process to me. Many of the cust. service responses seemed like canned responses, which scared me more. After being neurotic & stalking on LinkedIn, a Senior Vendor Relationship Manager made me feel better about the purchase. Then I did receive the electronic tickets, but they disappeared from my Apple Wallet the day of the event. They were retrievable from the seller's email, but the entire time leading up to the scanning of the tickets was extremely stressful."
"Vivid has glowing declarations about their customer service on their website in their FAQ and responses, but they clearly don't have a clue about their customer's experience. Customer service is more than sending hastily written one-off responses with zero accountability and zero follow-ups. I have been trying for close to a year to get a refund for a concert that has been rescheduled three times. You simply cannot get in touch with them! So combine their customer service with their audacious junk fees and you have what I call a ** company. But here's the saddest part about this whole thing these artists that we support are saying nothing about how their fans are being scammed."
"I purchased ""tickets"" to a concert and received an email with a link to the ""tickets"" which did not work. I downloaded their app, logged in, and tried to access the tickets that way, which also DID NOT WORK. I was turned away at the entrance to the gate because they did not place the actual tickets with the scannable barcode neither in the email they said had the tickets, nor their app I downloaded with my confirmation of purchase."
1 star because there is no option for ZERO STARS. The marketplace is simply an area where sellers can get your commitment to buy a ticket but they don't have to deliver until immediately before the event and if they don't they just give your money back. Which means sellers are free to get a higher price and screw you over. I bought 3 plane tickets and hotels to Circuit of Americas Formula 1 for $5200. My tickets are $1500. They aren't here. Customer service is staffed from India and they just say read the fine print. I will never use this company again.
"SCAM AND A FRAUD!!! Do not ever purchase a ticket through this scammers, you will only lose your money and will never receive the tickets you purchase here. I ended up purchasing another tickets at the box office."
"If I could give the a -5 stars I would. Their concert tickets MIGHT be ""cheap"" BUT don't be an absolute idiot (like me) and buy from them. I can guarantee it is not worth it to have to call them (because there WILL BE a problem with your tickets) and be waiting FOR OVER 48 MIN for someone to answear and then WAITING ANOTHER 30 MIN to be transfer to someone else, who will LIE TO YOU. Finally you will call one last time and they are gonna tell you ""there is nothing we can do."" I wasn't able to go to my Harry Styles concert. I spend over 1 thousand dollars on tickets. Don't do it."
"All communication is with a computerized response. Nobody answers the phone or replies to an email. If you are having trouble receiving your tickets from who knows where, there is not any one available to speak to you. They do not answer the phone. Horrible company."
I had ordered tickets from a DIFFERENT place and they did not deliver tickets. I was at the venue and able to purchase and get tickets electronically sent to me within 1 minutes. I was able to attend an event when another ticket distributor failed me. Very grateful!!
"Concert just started and I didn't get my tickets. I've spent a week trying to get my tickets only to be told - over and over and over again - ""please monitor your email for your tickets"". Getting a refund is going to be a challenge because they are now claiming that they only provide refunds for cancellations. This despite the fact that their 100% Buyers Guarantee, which they proudly display when shopping and purchasing, states that ""You Will Receive Your Tickets Before the Event"". I pointed out that even their Terms & Conditions state that on time delivery is guaranteed. They are rude and bend over backwards to avoid making any commitments. You will lose your money, your time and your sanity."
"Purchased tickets for my son's birthday for the Dude Perfect tour. I was told I would receive an email no later than the day before to accept my tickets. Clicked on said email and it said my tickets had already been accepted from ANOTHER email. Inquired three different times, was told they would contact the seller, and of course they never ""could get ahold of them"". There is NO accountability for what happens to your $$$ or for the sellers to deliver what you purchased. DO NOT buy from this site!!!! Unacceptable!"
"After purchasing tickets it took three confusing emails and one lengthy phone call just to ensure my tickets were secured. My event was canceled, six phone calls and a dozen emails have not yet resulted in a refund, and the last few times I called my call was disconnected after being on hold for nearly an hour. Never been so frustrated dealing with a ticket agency, will never use them again and highly recommend staying away!"
I went online to purchase tickets to a concert at a theater near me. The show was presented as if by the local theatre so I preceded to select seats. When it came time to pay I realized it was through Vivid Seats. I should have researched then but it appeared so legitimate. I selected two seats for $97 dollars each. When my tickets arrived they were for two $65 seats. There were no offers to refund the difference and although they claim to have wonderful customer service no one has responded. Hope this saves some else from aggravation and loss of money. Also the theatre will not know until the night of the performance if I will even get the cheaper seats.
"Never use this company to purchase tickets!! I purchased tickets in February of 2020 for the Rolling Stones in Tampa. Due to Covid the July 5th concert was cancelled. I called Vivid Seats for months to get a refund. They would not give me my money back because the concert was going to be rescheduled. The concert was rescheduled for October 29th 2021, I have tried for weeks to get Vivid Seats to send me the tickets. They will not answer calls, emails or live chat - so I will be out almost $600 for 2 tickets that were overpriced and never delivered. Please use another ticket vendor. Vivid Seats is a scam."
"I have tried reaching Vivid seats CS for over a week now. They have the worst outlets, worst help. This is absolutely horrible. If I could 0 stars I would. I do not recommend this place. If you ever need any help they won't answer calls, emails, etc."
"I was able to score tickets in a Suite to the Cowboys/Giants game on Oct 10, 2021....but it did not come with a parking pass. No biggie.... I will just buy the pass myself, right? So I bought a pass on Vivid Seats....got the email that I would receive my ticket via email soon. But that email never came. I logged into my Vivid account, and it says in my status that I had received the pass. But, still no email with that pass. So, I try to call....estimated wait time? 83 minutes! But it offers to send me a link to a ""live chat"". This chat is not live.... I was having a conversation with a computer that took me through the same loop of responses over and over. So, I sent an email....after all, I still had 2 days before my event. No response. Tried contacting them the next day via phone....estimated wait time? 76 minutes! So, I sent another email....no response."
I purchase 2 tickets for 345 dollars to see the Kat Williams Comedy show at the Brooklyn Barclay Center. A few days before the show I was trying to accept my ticket which was delivered by a third party seller. But for some reason I could not accept the tickets to transfer it from Vivid Seats to ticket master. Long story short I was unable to retrieve my tickets. Spend hours with live chat. Could get them on the phone because you had to 54 minutes for someone to talk to you. I had to purchase 2 new tickets from the box office to see the show. Today when I called and explained to them. They told me no refund because the seller did his part by delivering the tickets and they can't refund my money. Don't buy from them please. They service customers is the worst.
"This is the worst ticket seller ever!! Don't get robbed by them!! I purchased tickets to Jelly Roll (order #**) and received order confirmation via email and through their app. I however never received the actual electronic tickets. After standing in line for 2 hours I was told the app order confirmation was not the tickets and was turned away. Because Vivid Seats was a 3rd party provided the venue couldn't do anything for me. I then tried to call Vivid Seats from the venue to resolve, however was never connected to an agent in time! "
Sellers rack up the price on all tickets to outrageous prices. Fans come from all walks of life and they are making tickets unavailable. Stealing experiences from real fans who truly support the artist. This site is a place for greedy scalpers.
"I bought tickets online for a show in Houston. They send me a bad link to accept my tickets, and they say they can't do anything because the tickets were accepted. ""But not by me,"" I say to them. Still nothing, and they refuse to help me further. DO NOT USE THIS SCAM COMPANY. YOU WILL LOSE MONEY!!!!"
"No live person ever answers the phone always a “high call volume""!! Sent countless emails and never the same answer!! Website says that the have 110 credit program… how about no!!! FGL CANCELLED BY FGL!! Show will be in August of 2022 no thanks not traveling for them!! Feeling jaded and angry."
"The woman I was trying, keyword, trying to tell my issue to hung up on me after I Waited over an hour to get through. She had to worst attitude and wouldn't even let me speak. Worst experience I have ever had with a company. I will never use this company for buying my tickets again. They also won't refund for buying a ticket for the wrong day, even if you just made the mistake two seconds ago. If you for some reason don't put in your email correct, you'll have to wait over an hour to speak to someone. Just so they can tell you that they don't know when you will get your confirmation about tickets that you bought for the wrong day. So when you do TRY to sell them to buy the right date, the event will be done. DON'T USE THIS COMPANY!!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! THEIR PHONE REP HUNG UP ON ME....ENOUGH SAID."
"This company is a scam. They sell grotesquely overpriced tickets, and they typically do not deliver the tickets. My tickets were marked up 1000% and they never arrived. And they do not respond to customer inquiries. Do not use this company. And get the word out."
"There's mixed feelings about the way the pricing and availability are, there isn't enough information about the company and whenever you hear about scams it does trigger on this website more so than others."
"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing my tickets. Unfortunately the same thing happened to me as every single person who purchased from this company. My tickets said they were transferred but I could not use them. They wouldn’t scan, wouldn’t work. The service from T-Mobile trying to help me was incredible though. They were unsuccessful in getting them to work also, but did everything possible to access my account with them. They offered different seats so we were still able to see the game luckily. They also said that Vivid is the worst and I shouldn’t ever buy from them. They see this all the time. "
"Ordered tickets 3 weeks before game, received confirmation of tickets ordered. When I received notice to download tickets they were for a different row below the ones I ordered and I was charged for the row above me which I ordered. I tried for several weeks to get this resolved before the game however, Vivid Seats does not follow thru with their errors. I gave them all the info they requested showing the wrong tickets and they have employees that do not know what they are doing and keep requesting the same information. Really bad experience. The overcharge amounted to $130.52. We went to the game and used the tickets of lesser value. I thought if I ordered them early we would get what we wanted. I have copies of confirmation of original order. I sent both copies of wrong and correct tickets to Vivid Seats per their requested. Lot of good that did."
"Never ever buy tickets for $600 from Vivid Seats. I bought 3 tickets for the show Wicked, till the last day didn’t get anything. I was calling, emailing live chat but no response. Then I was told that my seats are gone but there are other seats available for $100 discount which will be credit to my account. It’s been 2 days. I didn’t get credit or any response from them. Do disappointed and disturbing for dishonesty. I have all the proof in form of a screenshot."
Purchased 4 tickets. Several hours later I was contacted and advised that our tickets had been sold elsewhere and were no longer ours. The price of same seats tripled and we were out thousands in airline and hotel expenses.
"I recently purchased tickets thru Vivid Seats on Wed. Sept. 28 2021 for Oct 02 2021 Giants vs Padres game. Was told I would receive my tickets by Sept. 30 2021. When I hadn't received my tickets yet I called customer service. No answer, so I went customer service chat which I had to wait an Hour with the same message say high volume of customers service and please wait for the next available operator, After a bought 6 of those messages they send a, ""Would you still like to continue,"" I say yes. Same thing. Waiting. "
Wow. Where do I begin? I purchased tickets to a concert and performers canceled. I tried to find out if I could get a refund or credit to another concert. I sent two emails. No response from Vivid Seats. Then I went on 8 live chats. I was disconnected from every single one. The topper to it all was waiting over an hour for a customer service phone call that they disconnected. I initially did not want to participate in the class action suit against VividSeats. Now I do.
We did not receive tickets when we were supposed to. We contacted customer service in every way. Every call or chat took hours. They gave us no answer over a few days of contact with them right up to the day of the concert. The only answer we get was no refund! The doors for the show opened at 3 and I just got an email to print tickets at 5. There is no way we are making it to the show at this point and we are just out the money and experience. I beg you to run from this scam!
"My niece bought 4 tickets for BTS in FL and the event was cancel and no way to talk with someone about the refund. No answers to any emails, their phone call system just get rid of us because the event was cancel. What about our money??"
"Purchased concert tickets from Vivid In April for concert in Oct 21. Getting closer to the concert date I have not receive. I called sent emails, chat still no tickets. I called and talked to an agent, assured me I would get the tickets, they contacting the seller. The afternoon on the day of the concert I still don't have the tickets.  Since it is the day of the concert, I can't cancel my hotel, I feel like I have been scammed out of $340.00 for two concert tickets. I will file a fraud claim with Pay pal to get my money back. I should have read the reviews before I purchased the tickets from Vivid. Don't buy tickets from this dealer, go direct to the event box office if you can. Lesson learned!"
"I purchased 2 tickets for MotoGP in Texas, Tickets were not available so I lost $534.36 a week worth of hard work, customer service refused to contact Ticketmaster to find my tickets, I contacted Ticketmaster with no luck never got a response I guess because I never purchased from them, never again will use Vivid seats. William"
I purchased tickets for a football game through this service. Was not allowed into the event and after an hour and a half on hold was told to submit a form that I never received. I had to call back and sit on hold for over an hour to finally get the form that I then submitted. I was told I would have an answer in 3 days and a week and a half later I have received no response and have not been reimbursed.
"Do not buy tickets from Vivid Seats, besides the fact of being completely up-charged on tickets, the concert I bought tickets for was CANCELLED. It was proven cancelled on the official concert website. I am not able to get a refund because they claim the concert was “postponed”. There is no postpone date. The absolute worst customer service department I’ve ever experienced. You aren’t even able to call and speak with someone. The phone hangs up on you and you have to email. I’ve emailed 15 times and it’s the same email response every time. I’ve been completely robbed of my money with no help from customer service."
"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS WEBSITE. They will list incorrect information, steal your money, and their “hassle free” customer service is a scam, they don’t let you actually call or chat with them and they ignore emails. I bought a ticket that was listed November 11th 2021, that same day on another website I saw that the event was actually on April 12th 2022???? "
"Tickets were bought for an event scheduled last September, which was cancelled due to covid. Tickets were not 'delivered'. We agreed to have VS keep the $ and we bought tickets for the event this year. A week before this year's event, we only received tickets for one of the 2 days. I began calling VS (120 min. waiting time), teen attempted using chat to find out what happened to day 1's tickets. Chat response was slow - about 1-2 minutes between replies. After hours on the phone and multiple chat sessions that slowed as time passed, I decided to wait until we were in Boston and 1 day before the event. It got worse when communicating when we first were in Boston. Support said I should have the ticket link, but it continued to show no link. Support then tried to send the link to an alternate email, but that didn't work. Then, support had me create a brand new Gmail account and then sent the ticket link to that account. It did not work. "
"I purchased some tickets to the Frankie Beverly and Maze Concert - total cost 803.00 for 6 tickets. Few days later found out the ticket price was lower for better seats and asked about cancellation and refund policy. Response was no cancellation and my refund is resale the tickets. How can you resale some tickets when the prices are lower for better seats, so the end result is a lose which would be the same if you refunded my money. I said I would be writing the worst reviews about their company until I got satisfaction from what I was doing. I have never heard of not being able to cancel a sale - if they bought the tickets just give me my money and you resale them. Since the pandemic started it has been the time of tricky companies doing bad things just like this.."
"On 11/30/2019, my wife purchased tickets for a Celine Dion concert scheduled for 4/9/2020. Due to COVID this was rescheduled to 9/4/2020, which was a date conflict for us. As Vivid Seats would not refund, the only alternative was to list the tickets for sale and the only alternative was to sell them through Vivid Seats. We did, and they sold on 7/9/2021. However we did not receive any payment. We were informed that we would be paid 7 working days after the concert. It is now 9/29/2021 and still no payment, and I have discovered that the concert was again rescheduled to 4/3/2022. So, if this date holds, Vivid Seats will have held my funds for 28 months, and a second payment for these seats for 9 months. This is criminal!"
"Never ever use this ticket sellers. It’s totally fraud and you are not even getting your tickets in time. Also tickets are much expensive there for no reason. Liars, who stole your money. When you are trying to contact them it’s not possible and when you finally get there then after 2 hour wait they hang up on you."
"I purchased a ticket for a football game being held in London on 10/10/21. The shipping date to my NC home was 10/8/21. Tried to call CS and sent emails. Nothing! Won't talk live until 2 days prior. I admit that I misread the shipping date when I ordered but how would any legitimate company ship a ticket 2 days before an event that is occurring in another country, especially with COVID rules and flight requirements. I finally got a live chat and they told me that I was out of luck. Trying to resell an extremely overpriced single ticket is impossible. Why cannot the tickets be electronic????"
This has been a complete scam. They have stolen $600 from my account. Do not buy from them!!!! I live in Atlanta Georgia and purchase Hall and Oates tickets from my fiance a month before we went. We got there and there were no signs...Not even an email.
"I purchased tickets on the day of the event, 4 hours prior. My tickets were never delivered. I tried calling and live chatting customer service - their wait times were an hour and they never resolved my issue. They kept telling me to rest assured that my tickets would be delivered on time, and then would end the chat. Now I can't get them on the phone to refund me."
"Ordered tickets 4 days prior to event. Received email stating tickets would be transferred by next day. Next day came and went. Called customer service and they told me ""Don't worry. Keep checking your email. Your tickets will be there by start of event. Event occurred and started. Yet no tickets. We missed free bobble heads given to the first 25,000 fans, waiting for over an hour to speak to someone at Vivid seats. Seats should ALWAYS be confirmed the night before event. Eventually they gave us new seats but we missed 8 mins of the game. NEVER AGAIN!"
"After being on hold forever I tried to texting and was placed on hold forever. Every time it says it was transferring it would come back saying, ""Error. Try again."" This turned out to be an impossible ticket because once I got in the stadium and looked for that seat I found the entire section filled with the Wisconsin marching band. I have yet been able to reach anybody live at Vivid Seats. Never ever will I deal with this outfit again and I will sue if I don’t get my money back."
"Ordered and paid for tickets in June for a September concert. Tickets never transferred. Emails not answered, phone contact nearly impossible. Finally customer support called a young man with foreign accent so strong I could not hardly understand. No help. After more emails I received email saying the venue would release tickets about 48 hrs before the concert. Several days prior I received a bar code. At concert venue the bar code was not valid so I had to repurchase my tickets. The price Vivid Seats had charged me for the invalid tickets was over 200% higher than box office price. As a retired police officer I thought I was beyond being scammed."
"I purchased tickets, received them and the show was postponed. On the rescheduled date, I was told they were invalid, sold to someone else. Trying to get reimbursed and have had nothing but the run around. Ready to sue them."
Vivid Seats is illegally selling tickets to events. They are not allowed to resell tickets for. They were unwilling to reach out to the seller to confirm how they are able to resell the tickets even though I've provided proof that the event organizer doesn't allow any reselling and will not permit entry. They've also delayed delivery to just the day before the event. Customer service is very unhelpful and provides generic stock answers. Over $100 in just booking fees for an absolutely rubbish service. I will report the sale of the tickets as fraud to my credit card company.
"I recently purchased seats and the Guarantee Insurance through Vivid for tickets to a LSU football game last weekend and received a confirmation from Vivid that the tickets were sent to me. The tickets NEVER came. The morning of the game, I sent a direct email to them about the fact that I have not received my tickets. I went through the Vivid Mobile App support and received a text message saying to wait for the next available person. This text response happened every few minutes, then after several messages like that, they sent me a text asking if I wanted to continue to wait. I replied yes over a dozen times. After doing this for over an hour, I then called support for which I received a voice message that the hold time was going to be 119 minutes. Since we were driving to the game I left my phone speaker. After 1 hour and 50 minutes the message then said the wait will be 108 minutes. "
Absolutely terrible I am appalled. They are impossible to contact and the automated voice system is completely useless. I booked tickets and it has taken forever for the website to send me them. I am likely missing the game I was going to and haven't received any money back. Will never use this booking site ever again. Don't use this site.
"I purchased 2 tickets for a total of $265, on concert day when I was able to download the tickets, I found that the tickets were actually $56 each. Realizing I was charged $153 over the ticket price I contacted Vivid Seats (this is NOT an easy process, you can't talk to a person, you have to send an email). I stated that I knew there would be fees but that there must have been some sort of error. Their response is very canned and they are telling me the price is correct. I will never use them again and suggest no one else does either. Besides all that, the only way to talk to a human is to select the option to purchase tickets, when you explain to the sales representative that you want to speak to a customer service representative, they put you right back into the endless queue with no human options."
"My husband purchased two tickets for Jason Isbell at The Met in Philadelphia for June of 2020. This concert was rescheduled twice due to Covid. Days before the actual show, we received an email from Vivid Seats stating that our new electronic tickets would be sent to us the day before the concert. We never received the tickets and have never been able to get a response from customer service. Can't get an email back, can't get anyone on the phone, can't get an answer from their online chat. It's a complete scam and we are owed a refund that we will probably never see. Save your money. We had to buy new tickets at the box office at the venue where they told us Vivid Seats was known for doing this."
There is no customer support from this company. I was never able to reach an agent via chat or email. All I ever got were automated messages. I went on Vivid Seats to buy concert tickets for me and my husband. I initially just bought two tickets that I thought would be closer to the stage but I found out they were far to the left (Vivid seats doesn't reveal the specific seat location until the tickets are actually bought). I wanted seats closer to the center so I bought two tickets labeled center row and placed the first two tickets I bought on sale.
Would not refund for a cancelled event then gave me a credit then refused to honor. Got the run around at every turn. Got disconnect every time I call. They are crooks. This is the worse company I've ever tried to deal with. They need to be shut down.
"We waited 18 months and traveled 4 hours to see Michael Buble only to be turned around at the gate because we didn't have a negative covid test?? We were told nothing about this requirement from the concert people or vivid seats. Vivid Seats won't even talk to us about getting any kind of a refund or even credit for the 803 $ we lost!!!! There are plenty of good ticket agencies out there, use them, not vivid!!!"
I bought tickets for a Sep 18 football game on Mar 31. The incorrect tickets were delivered to my app on Aug 31. After two weeks of nothing but runaround from customer service the game came and went with the same incorrect tickets are still in the app. Furthermore customer service flat out lied and said the correct tickets were delivered on Sep 16th despite no supporting evidence from them and no response to the screenshots of the wrong tickets in my app. Horrible company.
We bought tickets to the game in April of 2021. We were told that the tickets would be delivered by September 15th 2021. That date came and we received an email from Vivid Seats telling us to look out for our electronic transfer. That never occurred. I reached out to them the next three days leading up to today the 18th day of event. I sent 4 emails and was on chat with them daily. All the while they told me they’d be delivered. Earlier today we decided we were going to cancel our trip because we could not trust we’d have tickets to our event.  
"Customer Service horrible. I had to call at least 10 times and no one could help me to receive the tickets. Wanted to tell me I would get them 2 hours before the event. ""Just keep watching your phone."" WTH. I went from Florida to Vegas for the show and I should wait and see if the tickets come. They guarantee their tickets or money back supposedly but I don't believe you would have much success getting your money. DO NOT USE THEM."
"Purchased OVERPRICED TICKETS online, and they were not delivered, When I got to the Event, and still had no tickets delivered to me, I did get through to Customer Service. They put me on hold and THAT WAS THE END! I had to buy tickets at the gate because my grandson was coming. They have a terrible reputation for a reason!"
Bought 2 different orders of parking passes on Vivid. First is cancelled because seller changed his mind and didn't want to sell them to me anymore. Got a 10% off my next order coupon. Vivid seats is horrible. They are going to charge that broker 200% who changed his mind and keep those profits for themselves after screwing me over - yet I only get 10% off my next order. Somehow they cannot send an order placed in the morning on a Friday for Saturday Delivery for a game that begins at 7:30pm the following day. Early Saturday delivery service can guarantee 9am deliveries and regular Saturday deliveries can also be guaranteed by NOON or 3pm depending on location. Many options. Refuses to listen and just wants me to use my fake pictures of parking passes. Unbelievable.
"If I could give negative stars, I would. It is the day of the concert, just a few hours to go, and not only have I not received my tickets, but I have also not been able to get a hold of any customer support person. For the past few days I have been emailing and trying their chat without getting a hold of a single live human being. I called their customer support number this morning and was on hold for an hour and a half without getting a hold of a live human being. I gave up and bought new tickets through Ticketmaster (received my ticket barcode instantly) and contacted my bank to dispute the Vivid Seats charge, hoping I'm refunded since I paid for tickets I never received and have not been able to receive any help. Do not use Vivid Seats ever, for any reason."
Purchased ticket in May for a Sept concert. Day of show and still no ticket. Emails were never answered. The people on the page chat were great! Took about 20 minutes for anyone to answer it though. They were able to find out that the seller of my ticket didn't release his ticket and that I should have it by the time the show started or I would get a refund. I was disappointed!! I did another chat 2 hours before the show and again they reached out to the ticket owner. I finally got the ticket 1 hour before the show. I spent a lot of time trying to find out where my ticket was and was stressed out! I would not recommend getting a ticket this way.
It amazes me that after all the backlash this company is still operational!! I had 2 horrible experiences!! First I ordered tickets to a show that was $400+ after waiting forever to receive them I started panicking and tried AT LEAST 20 times to get help and find out where my tickets were. Finally spoke to someone who assured me I would get my tickets before the event. I received them literally HOURS before the event and they WEREN'T EVEN THE TICKETS I PAID FOR!!! So my $400+ show ended up being over 1k because I bought a back up set directly from Ticketmaster with absolutely no issue. But of course because they sent them their so called buyer guarantee is void for any refund. 
This company messed up the electronic delivery of my tickets. They do not answer their phone number and refuse to refund the money. I wish I had read these reviews before buying. I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and suggest that you do as well! What a ripoff!
"Tried to called them to get refund for show get cancelled (COVID-19). Never never ever answer my call, just answer by robot and in circle. They ask us to email but they never replied. Just be careful. They ONLY responsible money IN, no money OUT when the event cancelled."
"I ordered two tickets, which I never received, and spent hours with customer service trying to receive. Then when I didn't get them, ordered tickets from StubHub and got them immediately (I had already flown from California to Washington to attend the Husky Football game). After it was over, I spent an hour with ""customer service"" trying to get a refund, or credit, but was denied. Please use another, more reputable vendor."
"Hi everyone! I do not often write a bad review, but I am so sad about our experience with Vivid Seats! My husband and I purchased baseball tickets to a Twins' game this summer and spent nearly $400. It was for great seats on a Saturday afternoon. The game ended up getting rained out, which is obviously not their fault but what happened next completely floored me!"
"Purchase NFL football tickets for Oct 17, 2021 game for Washington and Kansas City Chiefs from Vivid tickets. Purchased Section 126 row 4 instead they gave me section 126 row 14. Have knee replacement cant walk or climb long distances. Paid $709.00 for these tickets. I have called and called, emailed. No response to rectify the situation. Will report to Federal Trade Commission as well."
"Horrible experience! BUY SOMEWHERE ELSE!! Horrible experience!! DO NOT USE!! This is the worst service ever if you have an issue. I placed 3 orders for a Clemson football game. On 9/1 two of the orders were transferred to me with no problem. The 3rd order however was never transferred. I sent over 20 emails, waited hours to chat with a representative and hours and hours waiting to speak with representatives. For 10 days prior to the event I kept getting back a form email saying I would receive the tickets. I never got them!! They kept telling me they would reach out to the seller to have him send them. "
Vivid seats selling tickets for Elvis concert at Festival place in Sherwood Park on Oct 30 that is not in existence. There is an Elvis concert on Sept 25 where tickets are less than half of what vivid is selling for Oct 30. Easy to see how someone would purchase unknowingly. Also vivid is selling tickets to a Herb Alpert concert on April 13 at same venue. This is a legit concert but tickets on Ticketmaster are $61-$91 CDN and vivid is selling for $102 -$306 US.
"I bought two football tickets. I intended to go to the game but couldn’t. I  tried to resell them, unsuccessfully, until the last 48 hours before the game, they did not give me a way to upload tickets because they never sent me a PDF file, I had to use two other apps to get the tickets, do not use this site. There is no live person and even their chat bot just gives you the same message every time, they do not return emails ever, I’ve been working on this for one month. I have probably put in about 11 hours of computer work just to get to this game. It’s outrageously ridiculous"
"Vivid Seats fails to fulfill its ""100% buyer satisfaction guarantee"". When the pandemic hit, Vivid Seats refused to refund my ticket purchase despite the concert cancellation. When the concert was rescheduled, Vivid Seats informed me my tickets would be transferred to me via electronic transfer but the tickets never came. After waiting to hear from an agent, Vivid Seats claimed it was not their responsibility to deliver my tickets because they are a ""secondary seller"". Do NOT buy tickets through Vivid Seats!!!"
Tried to open an account to sell football tickets but they would not approve because of no prior history selling. Makes no sense at all. I guess they are not looking for revenue from my ticket sales. Oh well again Stubhub and Ticket Master kicks their bottom. I will recommend to others not to use their service.
"Ordered two tickets for Chicago the band, called Vivid, spoke to the rep, took 55 minutes, they resolved nothing! I only gave them one star because there’s nothing less!! My suggestion is if you can find another ticket venue USE THAT ONE!"
This is my first review on anything so I hope this helps people. I purchased sports tickets from Vivid Seats with their 100% buyer guarantee and they sent me the wrong tickets. Wasn’t even for the right date. I called and tried to chat but kept getting hung up on. Their only support is thru email. After many emails they will not take liability for their mistake nor give a refund or fix the problem. They continue to pass the problem on to the seller of the tickets. I understand people make mistakes but Vivid Seats and the 100% buyer guarantee they advertise is not true. Lesson learned please be careful with this ticket broker site.
"Our daughter purchased tickets from this site and a few days before the event had still not received her tickets by UPS, then to email or by text and that the delivery would be made to her hotel address still no confirmation. Today this company finally came up that they would be delivered by a complete stranger in front of the venue in Vegas to two young female adults. I am utterly horrified that any company would make this kind of arrangement between a two young female adults and a complete stranger hundreds of miles from home. "
"I purchased a ticket yesterday for the PSU-Wisconsin football game that is today. Vivid Seats shows my tickets as ""delivered"" and charged my account. I got an email from seatgeek saying the tickets were there. When I login to seatgeek to ""accept"" the ticket, it won't let me accept it. Seatgeek says the problem is on vivid's end. Vivid won't answer phone calls. The game is in less than four hours and the tickets that I have paid for are unable to be accepted in seatgeek and vivid offers no refund. Do not use this service. They stole my money. They offer no easy way to be compensated. They say they offer a buyer guarantee, but they don't. They should be shut down."
"I bought tickets for the Hollywood Bowl. They were supposed to be delivered to my mobile app 2 days before the concert. I called and did chats which amounted to 6 hours of my time. The morning of the event they sent tickets that were incorrect, I spent many hours trying to sort this out. First they have untrained people answering questions so they couldn't understand that a Box number was a seat. They kept telling me I would get the correct tickets but 3 hours before I had to leave I still didn't have them. They refused to give me anyone to talk to that could help and they refused to refund my money. Really the worst customer service ever from Nikka and Yuni. They refused to let me talk to anyone else. I caution everyone to never use this company. I lost $2000.00. Unbelievable."
"They Ripped me off with my purchase, selling me concert tickets. I bought 2 tickets and was forced charged $60 overnight and got them 2 weeks later and these tkts were offered $400 LESS by them a week before concert. Not trustworthy Company, PERIOD."
"My game was relocated and thus the tix no good, but Vivid assigned ""postponed"" so they could delay response. Phone and Chat were disabled. Once my order was confirmed in their system, the auto chat and auto phone system replied: ""this chat will end"" or ""this call will end"" followed by ""please email"" but when I email support@, the reply comes back ""we do not recognize any order with this email address."" This is, in effect, a brick wall put up to delay the reimbursements Vivid must pay."
"I never received my ticket transfer! First time I did a chat with customer service and they took a long time to reply throughout. After trying MANY different ways of locating my transfer tickets, which I appreciated, they said they would have to request them again ""if "" they would do it? Was frustrated and asked if that meant there was a chance I wouldn't get them and was told ""that's not what I said"". I decided to call and talk to a live person. That person was helpful again having me check all of the same places. Then assured me that I would get my ticket the next day....same day as the concert. "
"I bought tickets to a football game off the ESPN website from this vendor. After all the fees, the price was significantly greater than the quoted price. Most galling, they charged an express delivery fee for tickets which were delivered electronically."
Bought a ticket for the Pat benatar concert on August 2021 in Burbank. Went to the venue. Nobody there. Did not send me notification of reschedule. Used their chat. They could not send me a new ticket for the reschedule date because they believed the event had already happened. They would not send me a new ticket for the event. They would not refund my ticket. They have gross indifference in regard to their customers and their competency is limited.
"I purchased two tickets as a gift for my son to his absolute favorite band. He drove six hours to the concert and was turned away at the door tonight. They told him the tickets were fakes. Customer service was no help, says they will send me a form for me to provide “documentation so they can open an investigation.” This is a total scam and I’m embarrassed I fell for it and feel terrible that I did this to my son."
Buyer beware. Vivid Seats does NOT have anyone to communicate with. I purchased a parking pass and did not receive it by the morning of the event. I called and was advised my wait time was 50 minutes. The voice recording said to go on line to their website and chat for faster service. Their chat line is a scam. It asked for my name and order number 5 times. There was no one on their chat line. I ended up going to the event and paid for parking there. While I was at the event I received a email with instructions on how to obtain my parking pass. BUYER BEWARE and forewarned.
"Yeah. Avoid this company. I can't attend the event and they will not allow me to access tickets I purchased months prior to the event until the last hour. So I can't even give them away! Their chat room is a farce and the phone number is not in service. A true actual scam of a company. Heed these fair words of a rational person's experience, STAY AWAY!!!"
"We purchased tickets over a month ago for a football game and although we received a confirmation email, we never received the tickets. We called on the morning of the game, and were on hold for over an hour. The rep told us to give them a new email address to send the tickets but they never came. We called back again and a different rep said we shouldn't have given a new email address and that we broke their agreement terms. They said they would do an investigation but the game has already started and they will not refund our money. We continued to get the run-around and were not allowed to speak to a manager. Their service is deplorable and they should be held accountable for breaking their own business promises. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! THEY ARE ABSOLUTE CROOKS!!"
"Had $840 worth of tickets to an Eric Church concert that was postponed for ""a year"". Vivid reps said they will not refund because event was not cancelled. They actually took the position that it was a good thing because I had the ""opportunity"" to sell the tix for more than I paid for them. Really? The venue is 1700 miles from where I live. Absolute joke - never again."
Buyer beware! They advertise a 100% guarantee but my tickets never arrived and I missed the concert. I am waiting to see if they refund the $265 I spent on nothing. I am a very disappointed customer!!!
"The way this company is ran is an absolute joke. I advice you not to purchase any tickets to any events through this company. It is an absolute nightmare. I purchased 4 tickets (seats) to a Gary Clark Jr concert in Dallas that was supposed to be at the Hifi at $97 a ticket. A week before the event I get a notification from my wallet app saying the ticket has changed to HOB (House of Blues). No email telling me of the change whatsoever. These same tickets are now being sold for 15 dollars a ticket and are now in a standing room section. I paid for the Hifi. More importantly, I paid for 4 seats so we could be comfortable and with the venue change they would not match our tickets to be in a seat, nor would they reimburse me the difference in price so I'm not only out $300+ dollars - we will not have the same experience. Vivid Seats - you are a joke."
"Bought ticket day of game; never got proper code (ticket) on phone to get into ball game; spent 1-2 hrs trying to correct with Vivid and could not get through. Could not get into stadium, Vivid will not refund my money. I will never use them again. Terrible company. One person hung up after 1 hour wait (Barns) and another person (Jen) told me since event passed no refund. Horrible business approach."
"One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had. I received the wrong tickets to a show, 4 days prior to the event. Every time I tried calling or talking to an agent online was an hour+ long ordeal - they clearly extend out the hold times as much as possible to avoid the costs of problem resolution. When I did manage to talk to someone, they inevitably repeated the same lies for me to wait and it would be resolved. I never did receive the correct tickets - luckily I was able to buy prior to the show from another site. Their ""100% guarantee"" is complete garbage. I'm in the process of trying to get my refund right now. Have tried calling them 3 times so far and it's still ""being investigated"", even though they've already previously acknowledge the mistake. I'm not holding my breath."
I never received my tickets. I started attempting to correct this a week prior to the event. I never got a response. I finally waited an hour on the phone. I spoke with a representative who wasted another 30 minutes of my time and never did anything. I had spent over 700 dollars. Now I have to try and get it back. But since you can't really get through to anyone....
"I purchased tickets to a baseball game and never received a confirmation email. I called customer service and was told I misspelled my email and the only way I could get my tickets was to cancel my order and get a full refund, but I would have to re-purchase the tickets with a Vivid seats card or ebay card. I did so and then he stated that the only way they could refund my money was to activate a vivid seats wallet for an additional cost. The customer service agent was scamming me and I never received my tickets. I do not recommend doing business with Vivid Seats, they are scamming their customers and very soon they won't have any."
"I purchased two tickets ($1,000.00+) to a concert. The tickets were suppose to be transferred electronically but I never received them. I called customer service four different times prior to the event. I kept getting the run around on my tickets. The day of the event I still haven’t heard back from customer service and I never received my tickets. The next day after the event I called a final time to request a refund. Customer service was still no help. At this point I was done with customer service and the company altogether. I have recently filed a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. Vivid Seats should be ashamed of themselves for stealing and scamming people. I am extremely disappointed and will never purchase from them again. Always book with a direct source."
Bought tickets to a baseball game. They were supposed to transfer tickets to the BallPark App and the link they sent was broken. I contacted customer service SIX times to get it resolved. They said they could only help me if I provided another email. I gave them my university email and they said that wouldn't work. I gave them a different email and still haven't received any information and it is 24 hours before the game. I am out $100 and they will not provide me and with refund. They said I could resell but how am I supposed to resell tickets I don't have access to? This is truly just a scam.
"I ordered my tickets on Vivid Seats and my credit card was charged. I noticed the next day I never got a confirmation or the tickets. I went to my bank statement and noticed that I was charged and refunded. They never said that I was being refunded, so their customer service is horrendous. Go to StubHub. You may pay slightly more but you will not have any headaches. If you're looking for a bad time go to Vivid Seats."
"You are looped around with robocalls and can never reach a customer service rep. I will never use them again!!!! You can not redeem credits via their supposed rewards program. I have tried on their mobile app and on a laptop, no assistance is available. They don't respond to their supposed contact via computer either."
"I purchased concert tickets for 8/17/21 and the concert was rescheduled to March 2022. Vivid Seats did not contact me about the cancelation, yet their COVID-19 cancelation policy says that they will. To get a refund, you must ask for it within 21 days of getting their email (which never came). So I tried to reach out to them.I tried to contact them via email on their website, ""live"" chat (twice), and their 800 number. ""Live"" chat is not live. It's an endless loop, and kept saying my order number or my other identification were not on file. The phone call resulted in a long series of automated choices, and then a notification that I would have a 41 minute wait. So I called my credit card company, explained the situation in detail, and filed a dispute. Within the hour, Vivid Seats sent an email asking me to complete a customer satisfaction survey. LOL - But they still have not contacted me about the canceled concert or my tickets. I will never buy from them again."
"You cannot escalate and they refuse to assist. Just simply state, ""We cannot help you"" and have an attitude when talking to customers with laughing and disrespectful remarks in the background. Most importantly Vivid doesn't follow their own terms and conditions. Vivid broke their own terms and conditions and refuse to help their customers. Vivid robbed me of nearly $900. Vivid advertised a date of an event that had already been changed as the original date. Once the tickets were bought vivid then decided to notify me that the date changed when it had in-fact already changed several days before that. "
"I paid for tickets, Never received them. Contacted customer service who repeatedly hung up on me. They have a 100% buyer guarantee that is ""Designed to give you full Peace of mind, safety, and security."" They did not honor this! I did not receive valid tickets and they were not delivered prior to my event. It also says that they provide excellent customer service. I spoke to 2 reps last night (Samuel and Emma). Samuel was rude and hung up on me, said they had ""Proof that the tickets were delivered"", I asked him to share that proof and he hung up on me."
"They say they have a 100% buyer guarantee and if tickets are changes they will give equal or an upgrade. The tickets that were sent were not the ones I paid for and were not as good. Their customer service was terrible, 2 representatives said they were working on it. A 3rd, while we were driving to the concert said if I didn't think the seats were comparable, they would make it right (all after being on hold for at least 3 hours!). When I called to make it right today, they said they couldn't do anything. I plan to take them to small claims court."
"They sent me the wrongs seats for an event. I ordered VIP tickets to a concert and received GA tickets 5 days before the event (which cost 1/10th the price). I called (had to wait on hold for an hour), I emailed, I did their live chat. I interacted with individuals, but never received a response or refund, and the event came and went. They are an ABSOLUTE SCAM and take advantage of their customers. NEVER AGAIN."
"I paid over $800 for 2 tickets to a Bruno Mars concert in Las Vegas (including a whopping $95 service charge per ticket). According to UPS, the tickets were delivered and I signed for them on August 4th. However, I was not in town, nor did anyone else at the address sign for or see a UPS package. I filed an investigation with UPS who suggested I contact the sender. I contacted Vivid Seats. It takes hours and is nearly impossible to reach anyone on the phone or live chat.  "
"I bought tickets to a concert against my better judgement under the guise of the 100% buyer guarantee. My tickets were not transferred. I was smart enough to screen record my activity which proved the tickets did not transfer. I followed the helpful tips on Vivid website, including using different internet browsers, and finally at the suggestion of Vivid, signing in from a desktop (to retrieve mobile tickets?). I left the venue, back to home signed in from the desktop, no good. Tried with a different browser, no good. ***All action recorded via screen recordings or cell video.***"
I ordered tickets to an event that was scheduled to happen in 2020 that was postponed due to COVID. I emailed customer service and they told me to wait it out since the tickets will be eligible for the new rescheduled date. Well it's been a year now and I recently sent a message saying that I just want my refund. They refuse to give it to me and advised I should sell my tickets. Who is going to buy tickets to an event that doesn't exist? Absolutely absurd. I will no longer be purchasing from Vivid Seats again. Will also be advising people to not purchase from this company as well.
"I recently bought a ticket to go to Bass Canyon and the ticket was a scam! I thought it was just a reseller reselling a ticket, but it turned out to be a digital ticket when the event doesn't even have digital tickets. When I tried to contact customer support about my ticket, I wasn't even able to reach a CSR despite waiting several hours. Overall this site is a total scam and they don't check their sellers."
"I had ordered tickets to see a concert, which got postponed due to Covid. By the time it was rescheduled, I was no longer able to attend. So, I tried to get a refund because I would not be able to use the tickets, which were over $200, but because of their “all sales are final” policy, it was not an option. The only way to get a refund is if the event gets fully cancelled. So I then tried to resell the tickets to get my money back. It is the most confusing system to get to the actual selling of the tickets, and once I was there, went through the process of filling out all my information, I get an error message saying that the event must be two days or more for me to be able to sell the tickets. Yet I’m sitting here, more than THREE DAYS from the event. Customer service was no help whatsoever, and I highly recommend that if you are considering buying tickets for anything, use another service. Ticketmaster has never let me down."
"Lynyrd Skynyrd cancelled their concert on the same day we were to go see them. I was on the phone all day that day trying to contact anyone at Vivid Seats.... Phone and chat and never spoke to anyone, was on hold the whole time. Sent emails never responded. Got thru today and their answer for a refund was resell them, after I told them the concert was yesterday. Brad Paisley was another act and they said tickets were still good for that. I will NEVER buy from Vivid Seats again. Terrible response time and no consideration for a same day cancellation."
"We bought 2 tickets for the Sebastián Maniscalco show which was supposed to be on June 25th 2021 in Atlantic City NJ. This show was rescheduled for August 6 2021, and we were not able to commit to new date because we are from Florida and we were not able to get days off work for the new date. So we called customer service just to find out that there is no refund. They advised us to resell the tickets on their application. We did that, sold our tickets and shipped them to the buyers. Then we found out that money for our sale we will get in 7 days after the event. So we waited till after August 6. Today is August 9th, I got an email that my order is canceled and we need to resolve monetary issues. I called customer service, they even couldn't find my sale at all, guy hang up on me after 2 hours on hold. In their application my sale had disappeared. So I have a feeling it is BIG SCAM!"
"DO NOT BUY FROM VIVID SEATS. THEY ARE INCREDIBLY SHADY!!! I ordered a $40 ticket for a concert in my city through Vivid Seats, and the tickets were estimated to arrive to me via electronic transfer on August 1st. 5 days later, they still hadn't arrived so I tried to reach out to customer service. I was on hold for hours and so I used the live chat feature."
"Terrible experience! First charged a huge fee after the ticket price. Then tried to contact them & the text link didn’t work, tried the chat, it didn’t work so I waited on hold for an hour to finally speak to a human. I explained that I didn’t have a printer to print tickets off my phone but also there was no option on the tickets to print. Well I was just told I have to print them out, even though there was no option to print. They said there was nothing they could do, even though it stated on their website for a small fee, they could send tickets. So here I am, out $200 & no concert to go to! Nightmare to deal with!"
"Updated on 06/21/2022: I purchased tickets in January of 2020 to attend the Country Music Festival in Nashville TN in June of 2020 from a 3rd party ticket reseller, Vivid Seats. The festival was cancelled for 2020 and again in 2021 and just occurred now this past weekend, June 9-12. When it was cancelled for the second time, not knowing if I would be able to attend that far out, I requested a refund. I was told that the sale was non-refundable. This was a large purchase. It was a dream of a life time vacation, and we wanted really good seats, so we splurged. We spent much time on their website and selected the very best seats we could afford, paying $722 per seat. They refused to refund our money. So we made plans to go to the show. We had many communications leading up to the time of the show. They had originally told me that they would send me the tickets one week prior to the show via UPS overnight. "
"I ordered tickets through Vivid Seats and never received them. I was forced to buy alternative tickets 15 minutes before the game! They have since stated on their app that cancelled tickets are not refunded. I never received the tickets even if I did want to cancel them!!! They make it absolutely impossible to talk with anyone at the company, and do virtually everything via ""On-line Chat"", so you rarely are dealing with a human being. Even if you do manage to ""engage"" with a human being, they give you the complete runaround, and never stand by their word. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS ORGANIZATION!!! THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS!!!"
"Look...It is simple. Vivid Seats is a scummy, shady company. Just buy the tickets from the actual venue and put these quacks out of business. All they do is snag first time buyers. Look a FEW repeat buyers there are. ZERO chance you will ever get what you paid for."
"Worst customer service ever!! I spent at least six hours on four different occasions trying to get my issue resolved, I asked to speak with a manager and was told the managers do not except phone calls. They outsource to a different country, very hard to understand on the phone. I purchased tickets to take myself and my 10-year-old special-needs daughter to a baseball game in a city that required air transportation and a hotel. Before we board the plane I tried to call Vivid seats to inquire why I haven’t received my tickets yet and should we board the plane not having our tickets, I received a text stating that my tickets were sent and ready on a Monday and we did not leave until Thursday. They told me they guaranteed it and then I should board the plane we flew into the city two days before the event, first day no tickets, second day no tickets. One hour before the event no tickets, short story tickets never came."
"Purchased tickets on 3/3/21 and was promised delivery of ticket on 7/28/21 by midnight, 7/29 we were told we’d receive tickets by midnight 7/29. It is now noon on 7/30/21. Vivid has now told us we will receive tickets up to 2 hours before the start of the concert or our money back! We have close to $1000 invested into the concert/weekend and a 10+ hour round trip drive to attend. Very very disappointed. Even if we received the tickets we don’t then deserve the wasted time and stress this is causing. Stay away from vivid. Buy directly from the venue…."
"We ordered tickets for the Motley Crew concert back in 2019, of course due to the Pandemic it was rescheduled, this we understood. However this concert has been rescheduled two more times, no going into 2022. I had contacted Vivid to ask for a refund and they don’t Refund, instead you have to then list the tickets yourself! On top of that even after I had sold my tickets, we have to wait until the day of the concert to get paid for them? They make it very difficult and it’s hard to reach a person on the phone. Don’t waste your time and money here. I have now lost over $300.00. Not cool."
"We had tickets to a concert which was rescheduled due to COVID to an entirely different year. No credits or refunds will be issued by Vivid Seats even though we cannot attend the new date. This seems like a very shady way to due business, especially with the current state of COVID shutting down things."
I ordered tickets in March 2021 for a July 2021 concert. Week of concert no tickets. I call and they say not to worry. I will get in with 100% entry guarantee. 2 days before show same thing. 1 day same thing. Day of show no tickets. 2 hour and 25 minute wait times on phone and no response to chat. 7:01 get an e mail that I won’t be getting in. Show started at 7. Ask about 100% guarantee. No response. I would not ever recommend this company.
"I purchased two baseball tickets off of Vivid Seats. I can not go to the game. I tried for 30 minutes to reach a real person at customer service. When I finally got to talk to someone they could not help me. I wanted to list my tickets back on Vivid Seats for sale. The form to sell wants my seat numbers which do not show up on my order. Customer service's advice was, ""Wait until you get your tickets,"" which it said is the day before the event and then list them. The customer service person said sometimes the seller will release the tickets early, no help. Can I get in touch with the seller. No help. The worse customer service ever."
"I ordered tickets through Vivid Seats and never received them. I was forced to buy alternative tickets 15 minutes before the game! They have since stated on their app that cancelled tickets are not refunded. I never received the tickets even if I did want to cancel them!!!nThey make it absolutely impossible to talk with anyone at the company, and do virtually everything via ""On-line Chat"", so you rarely are dealing with a human being.

Bought tickets for a client and had major issues and tickets they sent were not valid when client got to PNC Stadium. I'd never use this service again. Horrible customer service and could never get anyone on the phone. Do yourself a favor and just use Ticketmaster a reliable service. This company is trash.
Ordered tickets to a game and realized after I accepted them that it was the wrong date and they were on the road hundreds of miles away. I immediately tried to cancel them and they would not refund the money. They said I am stuck with the purchase. I lost over $300.00. They just didn't care.
I bought tickets through Vivid Seats and then the show was rescheduled for 6 months later. This doesn't work for me and when I requested a refund I was told there are no refunds. They told me to try to sell my tickets to someone else.
"I ordered Ron White tickets 5/2020 for 7/2020. It was rescheduled to 7/16/21. We went to see the show last night to be told it has been rescheduled to 7/2022. I was not notified of the 2nd cancellation. I feel this is a valid reason for a refund but I cannot get customer service on the phone and the live chat is pre generated & states they do not provide refunds, instead I have to try & sell the tickets. No one is going to purchase tickets for a show that has been delayed for 2 years."
"I purchased a ticket for a PGA golf event taking place in August 2021. After making the purchase I have no idea when or if I will be able to have access to my ticket. I've not been able to communicate with them in any way, shape, or form. They say a shark does two things: kill and reproduce. That perfectly describes Vivid Seats. I hope this serves as a warning to others about crossing this company's wake."
"Vivid seats is an online scammer. This company acts as if they will sell you tickets but will only sell you false hopes backed by debt. I order tickets for the April Fools Comedy Jam...and boy was I a fool for using them and not a well known/trusted vendor. Here it is July 2021 and I have yet to have gotten a refund. When I contacted the company prior to the event to ensure it was still scheduled, I was ignored/sent automatic responses with no resolution as to what was going on with my tickets or my $800 almost $900 purchase. "
"I have tried contacting this company for a year regarding my concert tickets, trying to get an answer of whether I am receiving them or getting a refund with no luck. My concert is in a month and I can not get through to a person or a response via email and still have no tickets!! I bought these for my mother for Christmas and want my refund to buy tickets from an actual place or get my tickets but this company is awful and I feel completely scammed!!! DO NOT USE VIVID SEATS!!!!"
"We purchased 2 seats to the Dave Matthews Band for the show in West Palm Beach, Florida scheduled for 8/1/2020. The show did not happen due to the pandemic but Vivid Seats would not issue a refund. The show was postponed for an entire year. Unable to get anyone on the phone for a year. No response to emails and their 'live chats' were computer generated. We don't live in the area and are not able to make the rescheduled show, nor do we feel comfortable around 20,000 drunk fans that will not be required to wear masks. Lost almost $200 but the lack of customer service response is why they get 1 star. I will never use them again and will join the class action lawsuit against them for not refunding money during a pandemic. Best of luck to all of you...."
"This company is a complete scam. I purchased theater seats for a Lindsey Sterling concert in Vail, CO. I paid $166.00 for 2 theater seats. I selected the seats I wanted. What I didn't do, was look at the receipt to see that instead of selling me what I ordered, they sold me lawn seats. I contacted the company, and they claim that their terms and conditions state that since I didn't dispute the tickets when I received them, I own them. I volunteer at the venue and can get the lawn seats at no cost. A total waste of $166.00."
"I tried purchasing playoff tickets and received an email & text confirming our agreed price of $6628… About 10 mins after purchase I received a text saying do I authorize a $10,250 charge from Vivid Seats. Of course I text back and said I would like to pay my agreed price. All of their customer service is in India and they don’t give two ** about your problem."
"Perhaps the most frustrating online experience I've ever had: 1. Baseball game tickets not delivered on time -- missed first three innings trying to find tickets. 2. Vivid Seats makes you go through a separate Ticketmaster account, but failed to deliver the tickets. 3. Made approximately 10 attempts to work over phone or by chat to find tickets while game was going on -- all completely incompetent and futile."
"Bought tickets, they got wrong date and email address (but got payment correct). Event rained out, only Live Chat. Could not use because of ""wrong email"" little hope of getting a return. If you have a choice of paying double or getting free tickets from Vivid...Pay double...don't use vivid!!"
"I purchased Phillies tickets on 5/11, for a game on 7/1. I knew they would not come through electronically until at least the day prior but now the day of the game and 4 customer serv. reps & hours later I'm still trying to get to access to my tickets. I was told I had to wait for the seller to resend a link for the tickets and that may be up to 2 hours prior to the event and they could not even tell me if I would get my money back or not if the seller does not send the link by that time. I was told to call back if I don't get the link, keep in mind I was on hold for a min. of 30 min each time so now we'll be an 1.5 hours away from game time and I live an hour away. The tickets were also not cheap and a Father's Day gift for my Dad, the customer service reps did not care at all, just said there is nothing else they can do, it's pretty much out of their hands. Very frustrating and I will never buy from them or another second party service again."
"I purchased sports tickets to the Boston Red Sox vs. Houston Astros for the June 10, 2021 game via Vivid Seats online website. I took possession of the tickets ""digitally""....On June 10, 2021 I drove to the game (which is over a two hour ride from my house in Cromwell, CT). When I got to the game I attempted to scan my digital tickets at the gate of the Red Sox stadium and they were denied. About 20 minutes prior to me getting to the game, I received an email from MLB ballpark app that the tickets were ""cancelled"" (once you purchase baseball tickets from any third party provider such as StubHub, Vivid, etc. they are transferred to this app). "
"Me and 120 other people were left out of a concert because of buying tickets through Vivid Seats. IF YOU WANT TO ATTEND A CONCERT AND NOT BE ALLOWED IN, DO NOT PURCHASE THROUGH VIVID SEATS. Not only was the QR code not detectable by the QR code scanner, but the QR code disappeared on the app after the event started. Sounds fishy? Let me elaborate further... Vivid Seats does NOT offer any Customer service after 5pm, which is funny enough, concerts and events usually happen after that hour... I suggest to stay away from this company, especially since Ticketmaster is exclusive with their system of event tickets."
First you charge almost double for the Lucas Nelson concert with no assigned seating. 213 dollars a ticket the tack on a 160 dollar service charge. You are pure scum. I will spread your lack of ethics to everyone in the booking agency business
"I purchased two tickets to a Red Sox game more than a month prior to that game. Weeks later I had NOT gotten the tickets. I emailed on their message site twice asking them to contact me and never heard back. I went on their live chat and was told I had to own a Smart Phone (!) that that was the ONLY way to get my tickets. I don't own a Smart Phone. After a couple of times back-and-forth, I was instructed how to Forward the tickets to my friend who does have a Smart Phone.  So I had to go through That Extra Step after having been ignored by customer service then having to go to live chat a couple of times. My friend Did get the tickets but with no Bar Code - without which the tickets are useless.  "
Purchased tickets to a baseball game. Fees were way more expensive than other websites (realized this afterwards). We did not receive our tickets so we used the online chat which was a headache because they kept asking us to go to all these different websites and download different apps to get the tickets and nothing worked. We contacted them multiple times. They refused to issue our refund or give us our tickets. We just kept getting the run around. Will never use this company again. Highly do not recommend Vivid seats.
"I paid for 8 tickets to Gabriel Inglesias for December 2nd 2021. One month after my payment I still haven’t received the tickets via email. I tried calling, texting, email to customer service. No response. I only get automated email and chat responses. I waited on hold for 1 hour to speak to a person, no response. I had to challenge the credit card charge to get a credit."
"Good luck trying to get a refund for canceled events. I followed their instructions, heard nothing, contacted them and was told they basically changed the rules and all I could have was an account credit. Apparently they needed to keep people's money for capital during Covid. At their prices there’s not many opportunities for good ticket deals. There is a class action lawsuit which should hopefully straighten them out: **. Take advantage of it if they screwed you over too."
"Truly deplorable customer service. Bought tickets in April for a show in August. Show was cancelled by performers June 11th. Chatted with customer service, informed we had to send an email for a cash refund, not credit. Emailed Sunday. Informed that the refund window is 21 days from ticket purchase. Now I have credit for future use. DO NOT USE THIS BROKER. One star is too much - and the canned Vivid response of ""DM us so we can explain"" is garbage and a screen to keep our money."
"I bought tix for Sixers playoffs and then Vivid sent an email to download the tix. When I tried multiple times the tix will not download.. I called multiple times and told that it’s MY PROBLEM.. They transferred the tix and they won’t help. THE 100% GUARANTEE IS A LIE.. YOU WILL “NOT” Get YOUR MONEY BACK. BUYER BEWARE!!! IF YOU DON'T GET YOUR VENUE, YOU WILL NOT GET $$ BACK!!!"
"Bought Avett Brothers tickets for July 2021 that has now been rescheduled to July 2022…which also happens to be my wedding day. Contacted customer service for a refund and was denied. Worst customer service I’ve ever encountered. I don’t ever write negative reviews, and I’ve never once disputed a charge on my credit card but I’m fighting this. Completely ridiculous."
We used their site to purchase Nats tickets. We ordered 5 tickets at $47 apiece. Nowhere on their site did it warn us a percentage of the service fee. When he hit purchase they ended up charging us $84 as their service fee! They didn’t itemize our receipt either so we couldn’t tell why it was so high. We waited 40 minutes to speak with a person and she basically said that’s how the company makes money. So buyer beware using this avenue. You might be better off using Stub Hub. I do not recommend this company.
"Don’t even consider buying tickets from Vivid Seats unless you really enjoy frustration and disappointment! Being a foolish optimist recently I purchased tickets from Vivid seats only to encounter the worst problem I’ve had with them to date. Briefly, this company specializes in obstruction as it relates to trying to contact any of their personnel via telephone and if you have hours to spare in that endeavor, more likely than not, you will be cut off during your 'conversation', or if particularly lucky, just misled and lied to."
"I purchased tickets in December of 2019 for a concert that was supposed to take place in July of 2020. Due to covid it was rescheduled to August of 2021, which means no refund. Soooo forward to this month when the concert was again reschedule to August of 2022, which still means no refund. They can re schedule as many times as necessary. So I figured I'd sell my tickets for face value on their site. I get a buyer, fine print states that you don't get your money until AFTER the event takes place. On the mobile app, you don't see this disclaimer. So now they have MY money AND the person who bought them. I'll never see it. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, NO REFUNDS, TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND I'M OUT MY MONEY. DON'T RECOMMEND!!!!"
"Ordered NFL tickets to a September game. Was instead sent PRESEASON tickets in August instead. I've tried to get this fixed with customer service for two weeks and all they offer are empty guarantees that it will be fixed before a week before the event, OR I'll get my money back then. I don't live in the city so not being able to buy plane tickets or get a hotel until a week before the event (not knowing of it'll be fixed or refunded at that time) is not feasible. They refuse to issue a refund. Issuing a charge back through my cc."
"Paid for insurance on two tickets purchased in 2019 for a June 2020 concert. Terms and conditions state coverage in the event of an epidemic (Covid is a Pandemic, even worse). Concert was rescheduled for more than a year after original date, year and a half after purchasing. Vivid Seats refused to refund me, so did the insurance through Allianz. I can not attend the new concert date. I tried getting a credit instead, that was also refused. Do not waste the money on insurance, and try a different ticket vendor."
"I paid for tickets, followed the steps to get them which included downloading an app. The tickets never showed up. So far I've spent about 5 hours on the phone with them, 4 of them being on hold, and am currently on hold for an estimated 58 minutes as I type this. They keep saying they are sending the tickets, or rather the reseller is since Vivid Seats doesn't sell the tickets, but I never got them. Three times sent, supposedly. They refuse to refund despite the 100% buyer guarantee. If this call doesn't work, I'm disputing the charge with my bank. Either way, I'll never buy from them again. Spend the extra 10 dollars per ticket at Ticketmaster instead."
"This business model should not be legal. They sell tickets they don’t own before they even go on sale. The fine print says they won’t guarantee delivery until almost the event date, but you won’t read that. So you can’t actually transfer it until you get it. Then, you can’t go you can’t sell it because you don’t actually have it. It is literally criminal but somehow technically legal. Do not give these insidious scumbags any of your money ever."
I was living in Canada and purchased a Ricky Gervais Ticket which is a dream of mine to see him live. With covid hitting the world I had to go back to Australia and have asked for my money back or to resell my ticket on their resell page however they won't do anything. The event has been moved 3 times now and 90% will get cancelled. So I have to try sell a ticket when I don't live in that country anymore with a 90% it will cancel .... This should be easy...
I bought tickets through Vivid Seats and made a typo mistake while writing my email. I tried every way to change the email and they told me that they were gonna send an email. Never happened. No money.
"I purchased tickets to an event that was already expired and therefore was unable to use the tickets (double header event). All information was exactly the same for that reason and I never thought they would sell be tickets that had already for an event that ended earlier in the day....my mistake there clearly. When I spoke to customer service by email they chose to ignore me and when I reached out again they chose to speak to me like I was an idiot (when I had documents proving what happened and how misleading the situation was). Regardless if they were able to do anything for me or not, I understand sometimes it is out of their control, but they had absolutely no remorse for the situation and instead chose to gaslight me and showed their disregard for the slightest bit of customer service or empathy."
"I purchased a pair of tickets to a Celtics game for roughly $600. Vivid Seats tells me that my tickets have been delivered when I didn't receive anything. I contacted their customer support several times where they simply said there is nothing they can do, and they're under no obligation to return my money. I opened a Better Business Bureau complaint and reported them to my state attorney general's office. Eventually, I contacted Ticketmaster (the seller) and they were able to help me obtain my tickets within 20 minutes. Vivid Seats was sending my tickets to wrong email address the whole time. Vivid Seats spent the entire time blaming me for the problem."
"I had a horrible experience with Vivid seats. Purchased 4 Seattle Mariners tickets and couldn't get into the event because you had to download 3 apps and they had to match up. They didn't match up and no QR codes were available to get in to event. The three apps were vivid seats, MLB ballpark and Ticketmaster. This doesn't make any sense that three apps have to talk to each other. I contacted vivid to open an inquiry and they wouldn't return my $365 back because they said that the email was sent to me with the instructions but the other two apps never matched up and worked. I would recommend to never use Vivid seats. Don't go third party if you have to. Stub hub is way better, easier, and better service."
"I have read almost all the reviews and I went through the same thing. They lie, you can't speak to anyone, Today I went to small claims court to file a claim. I am so upset how this company takes advantage of people and we are powerless. I will update everyone so you can do the same. I also called 7 on your side. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!! MAYBE WE CAN FILE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT."
"I ordered tickets from Vivid seats in 2019 that said Fleetwood Mac but it was not for the actual Fleet Wood Mac, it was for a band that plays their songs. I tried over and over to get a refund, but they would not refund me. Ironically, I went to purchase tickets from Vivid Seats for a concert in 2021, and they rejected it, why?  Because I tried to recover my money back in 2019, now they won't sell me any. I went to Stub Hub, a much better experience."
"We purchased concert tickets from Vivid Seats on 5/22/20. Due to COVID the concert was originally scheduled for 6/13/20, then rescheduled to 6/13/21 then rescheduled to 6/2/22. That’s right, over a year from now! The total cost for 4 tickets was $714.32. We requested a refund and Vivid Seats declined! So they get to use our money for over a year? And who knows, they may reschedule again! It is not right. This is a company that will not make amendments for a pandemic. We will spread the word."
"I spent almost $600.00 to the Motley Crue concert in Orlando and the pandemic hit and the concert was rescheduled for over a year away from the original date. Their posted refund policy due to COVID19 was posted on their website and it indicated that you could receive a refund in a hardship due to the pandemic and the concert being rescheduled. They have now had our money for over a year, the concert is not until June 27, 2021 and due to the pandemic, there is no way we will be attending the concert, in such a big place, with so many people. I will never purchase tickets from this company, ever again. On the Motley Crue website, they utilize Live Nation and they are actually honoring to refund the tickets purchased. After sending many emails and receiving emails back that was VERY rude, I will tell anyone that they should never purchase from Vivid Seats. They have horrible customer service and do not honor their posted policies at all."
"I made two different transactions with Vivid Seats. The first I had no issues with. The second, I regret immensely. I received the first order confirmation but not the second. I called Vivid Seats and they resolved the issue after two hours of trying to get someone on the phone. The day of the game rolls around, the tickets were supposed to be transferred to me, the tickets to the game were, the parking ticket I spent $55 on was not. I checked every possible platform for the ticket before the event, it was nowhere to be found. It was too late to contact Vivid Seats about the failure of receipt of the parking ticket. I had to spend $30 more dollars on parking at the event. I reached out to Vivid Seats about the failure of the transaction. They refuse to refund my money because they said the ticket was sent to me. Which was not the case. Do yourself a favor, do not use Vivid Seats and expect to refunded for your purchase if a problem arises."
Concert was rescheduled to a completely different date. Did not receive email with the new date. They lied and said that they sent one. Cannot get ANY refund. Absolutely crazy. DO NOT USE this company.
"Purchased tickets for Saturday May 22, 2021 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Received an email on April 8, 2021 that the event was cancelled. Vivid Seats refused to offer a refund. Tried to force me to take tickets for Sunday night in October. This company has terrible customer service. The first agent hung up on me. The second agent refused to let me speak to a manager. I will never buy tickets from these scammers again, and strongly encourage you to avoid Vivid Seats unless you want to be scammed too."
"Shortly after purchasing tickets, they were recalled and no longer valid. After over an hour trying to reach someone by phone, I was put on hold and after about thirty minutes, the call was disconnected. Same sort of response from chat. They take as long as they want to get back to you, but you have a limited time to respond to them before disconnected. I was told that someone would contact me regarding the issue. No one ever did. Out $300, had to purchase tickets on Stub Hub. It's been over a week and no one has ever gotten back to me. No luck with contacting by Email support either. Several attempts only to get automated replies."
My friend purchased some tickets for my birthday to attend a Houston Rockets game on Feb 17 and the game was cancel and rescheduled for April 7. She applied for a refund and submitted the inclement weather outage and other reasons why and being active duty Vivid declined her refund due to insufficient information even though she purchased the insurance. We had to come to a game that's over 3 hours from our location just to turn around due work call for us at 0900am. Thanks Vivid for not honoring your refund policy.
I was searching for Rockies tickets and found 4 I was thinking about. I realized that the date was wrong and could not back out. I tried to get a hold of a human being to fix the issue. Got stuck in phone tree hell. No one!!! I call the Rockies and they said call Vivid again. I never received the ticket and vivid refused to address the issue. Save yourself and your friends the headache. Use someone else.
They sell tickets for events that have been rescheduled but their dates are old. They will not stand behind their errors. Definitely not 100% guaranteed. Was told to take a hike the same day I purchased tickets for an event that was rescheduled a month ago.
"Not only did Vivid Seats not give me a refund for a cancelled event (scam) but they did not explicitly make me aware that I could not sell one ticket out of a pod of 2 tickets to an upcoming Cubs, rudely telling me it was my fault and they will be charging me an unspecified fee. I will dispute that with my credit card company when that time comes. All of their reviews on this site, Yelp and the BBB are one star for a reason. Buyer and seller beware. They are unapologetic scammers. Sad."
You can never get a hold of anyone to speak with. First of all they do not like to refund any of your money. I’ve been waiting to see a concert for two years now and I have not received any refund or I don’t even have a future date. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone to use Vivid Seats ever.
Concert rescheduled 2 years after original date and Vivid Seats will do nothing to help with a refund even though the tour is providing refunds. Vivid seats won’t even help resell the tickets. They basically won’t do anything!
"I purchased tickets for a baseball game, doesn't matter which one, Vivid Seats said event canceled even though the event is still showing on the schedule. Now refusing to get me to a real person or even a real response via the email they have sent me. They are not returning my money. I'll never use them again and will speak loudly to others not to utilize their scam services."
"I purchased 16 tickets to an MLB training game in Arizona. When I received my receipt for the purchase, 2 of the tickets were for a game at the same time and place but for the wrong team, which I didn't know was possible. I called immediately to request help correcting the tickets. It was practically impossible to get in touch with customer service and after herculean efforts and phone games a customer service (wow, can I call it that??) representative refused to help me in any way. Not only that, they said their service was infallible and it was my mistake. "
Purchased 2 Tickets at last minute to recently played Game between Detroit and New York. Sections and rows could be selected but not seat #'s. Received the electronic tickets a few hrs prior and noticed 1 seat had a WC designation. When I got to the stadium found the WC represented Wheel Chair and I was given a seat and an empty space to for a Wheel Chair to go in. Not what I purchased and Customer Service defended the transaction. Buyer Beware with this company!!!!
In 2019 I booked 3 baseball games through Vivid Seats ($946.60). When Covid hit the 2020 baseball season trip was canceled. I was offered the opportunity to receive 110% ticket credit with an expiration date of 01/2022 or 100% cash refund. Thinking 2021 we would be able to reschedule the trip I took the ticket credit and when able booked the 3 baseball games for 2021. Here we are in 2021 and 1 game has already been canceled. We reached out to Vivid Seats to ask for an extension to 05/2022 or a refund (hoping we would get a ticket credit extension and try again for the 2022 season).
"I bought 4 tickets from Vivid Seats for a Yankees spring training game in Tampa. I never received the email that supposedly gave me access to the tickets and consequently was denied access to the venue despite having a receipt that showed I paid the nearly $200 to gain access. When I contacted the company (which is difficult at best), I was told that I received an email which allowed me to access the tickets. I did not. And coincidently my sister-in-law had the same thing happen for the next day. Mistake? I think not. Do not buy tickets through this provider."
"I purchased tickets to the Rolling Stones concert in March of 2020. The July 2020 concert in Tampa was cancelled. It is now close to March of 2021 and I still have received no refund. It is impossible to speak with someone on the phone. Once, I reach a guy from the Philippines. He was reading off a script and was of no help. A little difficult to understand with the roosters crowing in the background and his accent. This is a Mickey Mouse operation at best."
"I purchased tickets to see the St. Louis Cardinals just before the pandemic shut down baseball. When it did hit, our trip was cancelled, as was the Cardinal's game. I reached out to Vivid Seats SEVERAL times to see about getting my ticket purchase refunded. After about 30-60 days I received an email giving me a 1-week time frame to request a refund; otherwise it would roll into a credit. I immediately responded to the email, yet never received the refund. I followed up several more times (which is a chore - there is NO clear way to get a human being in their help menu). They were unhelpful (at best) and rude. They simply rolled my $125 into a credit and refused ANY refund. Now their fees are so high (spring training tickets in 2021 carry about $33 each in fees) that my ""credit"" is useless. Go direct or go through Stub hub. This place is the worst!!!"
"I purchased tickets through Vivid, I did not get my tickets and so I was told to switch to 3 devices and reset passwords 4 times. Nothing worked and was only told ""sorry sir"" and still do not have tickets."
Bought tickets to Hillsong concert at Red Rocks in Feb 2020. Concert cancelled in May then rescheduled for Aug 2020 in a much less desirable venue at Fiddlers Green then cancelled. Already not worth the money. Nothing is rescheduled for any date or place in the foreseeable future. After 11 months asked for a refund from Vivid and was refused. Did a credit card dispute to no avail. Now I find out that Hillsong will have no tours in the US in 2021.
I purchased tickets in April 2020 for a Jim Gaffigan's comedy tour. The show was canceled and reschedule to October 2020 (which was also canceled). Vivid would not refund my money which totaled over $400. The company states that I only had 7 days to request a full refund for the tickets. So now I am stuck with credits that I cannot use. It is now January 2021 and I still don't have my money or tickets to any show worth spending the credit on since nothing is happening during the current pandemic.
I ordered two tickets for Pittsburgh and Hurricanes hockey my son in 10/2019 for a game in March /20 that was cancelled. I have asked for refund on multiple occasions and no reply came. Still waiting on response. Going to surgeon general now.
"Vivid Seats refused to give me back my money on Cher Tickets. I spent 1,071.48. Chers concert was cancelled 2 different times because of the COVID and they will only give me credit. They said that they sent an email to me and I was suppose to respond in 7 days. I never received the email. I have called numerous times and they won't change their minds. There are no concerts going on anywhere because of the COVID. They are a very bad company to work with and do not ever buy any tickets from them."
"I paid for four tickets for a Lauren Daigle concert on April 15, 2020. The event was postponed twice. It was officially cancelled November 16. I asked for refund via email. No one replied nor my refund issued."
"I purchased tickets from VIVID over a year ago for an event only to now find out they are reselling from Ticketmaster, who now will not support me for an event that was scheduled in March as COVID impacts cancelled events, not pushed to August of 2021 when I will have moved from the location by over 1500 miles...no support, no help, glad to take your money, but you WILL be on your own.  All efforts with customer service have led to them telling me ""GOOD LUCK in selling your tickets on your own, we will not help you nor provide a refund."""
This is worse company. I purchased tickets to Chris Stapleton and Kenny Chesney. They never gave me any feedback on cancellation from covid. They wouldn't give any type of refund along with. Chris Stapleton concert was 2 weeks ago here in Dallas and I couldn't get my tickets or anyone to answer phone. I finally got ahold of someone this week after they hung up four times on me. Then they wouldn't refund anything unless I went to dollar General with them on phone and they would instruct me on what kind of card to purchase. Huge scam...thats all this company is. I notified the Better business service today and made a report on them.Don't buy anything through them. Wish I would have researched first.
"I bought a VIP ticket to see Rick Springfield/Chicago in June 2020. Because of Covid, it was rescheduled to June 2021. Fine, no worries, except that the concert now only features Chicago. When I asked for a refund I was told that since it was rescheduled, they would not offer a refund. I pointed out that it is no longer the concert that I paid for since Rick Springfield will not be there. Their response was to send me a link on how to sell my ticket on their website! I cannot get through to speak to anyone in person. All communication has been done via email and live chat. I requested that my situation be elevated to a supervisor or a manager and I was told that supervisors and managers do not handle these things. What??? Unbelievable!!"
"Had 2 tickets to Ana Gabriel in Vegas, it was canceled- due to COVID. They email you stating you have 7 days if you want a FULL REFUND to your CREDIT CARD or they FORCE a credit. BAD COMPANY. They are taking advantage of the situation. I never received any email of all and if I received an email from Vivid Seats! Plus - SPAM FOLDER! I will never buy a ticket for that thief company and I will start a campaign again them to avoid they could get more money for more people."
"My event was canceled was sent the email with the following message. Full Cash Refund - If you wish to receive the full cash refund, no further action is required on your part. Your refund will be processed to your original payment source within approximately two to four weeks. Later was told I didn't respond to a email sent over a month later so I wasn't entitled to a refund. Tried live chat and every agent was named Jose. I find that odd and they weren't helpful only using the same basic responses."
You ripped off my 15 year old daughter! She paid for Miranda Lambert tickets. What company only allows a refund after 7 days???? You have had her money since FEBRUARY!!!! Since your ratings are falling pretty hard I know we aren't the only ones with this issue. Totally unacceptable!!!!
"Had 4 tickets to the Bangles and NYG game. The game was canceled- due to COVID. They email you stating you have 7 days if you want a FULL REFUND to your CREDIT CARD or they FORCE a credit. BAD BUSINESS! Covid isn't going away. They are taking advantage of the situation. I have a life, a job, and 2 little kids. I don't sit on my computer watching my email all day waiting to see if I received an email from Vivid Seats! Plus - SPAM FOLDER!"
"My tickets were used. They turned me away at the gate because they didn't scan. They walked me up to the seats and another couple was in my seats with the exact tickets that I had so the tickets I purchased were sold 2 times. No human will call me from Vivid Seats. They send you to text or chat with a robot and eventually after an hour of playing back and forth with the robot a human comes on and says, ""There isn't anything we can do to help you."" I missed out on half of the game, sat on stairs for 20 minutes until we were allowed to sit in seats that were nothing close to what I purchased. I spent $579 on my purchase and the seller or Vivid Seats are stealing from me and won't do anything about it. Ed **"
"I purchased tickets prior to pandemic, my event was rescheduled for 1 year out, I could not get a refund which was fine. They told me to sell my tickets so I did. Now they are saying I have to wait 10 business days after the event to get my money. I am out the money for the purchase and for selling the tickets."
"Bought tickets to a football game that was moved up a week due to Covid. We could not fly in for the moved up game. So I called them. They told me to accept the tickets and resell. You can't resell these tickets. I called the college box office, as told by Vivid Seats to do, and they were very upset that these tickets were sold to me in the first place. Basically said there is nothing that they can do and to take it up with Vivid Seats. Vivid seats said they dont have to honor the resell and the tickets are mine. The problem is these tickets were under a season ticket holders account and could only be transferred by him. When I informed Vivid Seats that the box office is very angry and what are my next steps....what if the athletic office invalidates the tickets? They said all problems with the tickets are mine now. Then they ended the chat. Absolutely ridiculous. As a professional sports season ticket holder myself, I will never use them and I highly encourage everyone go with Ticketmaster."
"My sporting event was originally postponed indefinitely due to Covid, and when I requested a refund in March of 2020, Vivid Seats refused to give one and said they will contact me when the refund option is available. When I contacted them again on 10/16/20 to request a refund, they refused again, saying that I messed my 7-day window to get a refund from the date of an email they claim they sent me on 9/28/20. I never received such an email, and even if I did get it, I should certainly be given more than 7 days to decide if I want a full refund or to be given merchant credit. "
"Absolutely appalling - never purchase seats from this outfit!! Particularly if you live abroad. No customer service - live chat is not live. Replies with computer generated answers and then cuts you off and you have to start again. Will not refund my NBA tickets ($1k AUD), only offering me a credit. As useful a chocolate fireguard. I live in Australia and my trip to the US in APRIL was cancelled due to COVID. Fellow Aussies NEVER, NEVER, NEVER use these con merchants."
"i called them and it's always automated, talk to our virtual assistant, kept repeating to me, ""Your confirmation no is wrong. Your order summary is not found,"" I never talk to a real person since March, they said they sent my tix, I can't find my tix they sent to my cell, this is a huge corporation so someone should be able to help, without us purchasing tickets, your people would not have a job.."
We purchased tickets to an event which has been postponed. We had contacted Vivid Seats as we had not received our tickets. They are claiming they had been shipped and signed for which they had not. We are asking for documentation of the signature but have not received any further response and unable to speak to a live person. We purchased the insurance as well however Vivid Seats is saying it is not valid in this situation. Very disappointed as we have used the company previously.
"Reporting this won't matter but typing it anyway - since it won't change their crap behavior. I have been fighting with my credit card company and this stupid company for months now. For an Elton John concert, they won't refund my $$ (even though I have a confirmation in writing that they will refund it and in fact it's on its way... Lies). They are telling me it's now rescheduled for 2022!! LOL really? So I now have to be sure and plan something for 2022... He could be dead, we could move, all sorts of ""could's"" and I am at their mercy for almost $500. "
"I paid big bucks for KY Derby tickets. The derby was cancelled and I assumed my credit card would be credited. I sent a note asking when I would get credit and I got no response. Then, a credit showed up on my account saying I had to use the money to purchase tickets from Vivid. They said if I had contacted them within 7 days I could have gotten a refund, but now I can't. Well... I sent a request and got no response. How can a business take your money, not provide any product or service and then keep your money? They claim a 100% guarantee, but that's obviously not true."
"November, 2019 I purchased 4 tickets as Christmas presents for May 24, 2020 Elton John concert in Orlando, Fl, for my children, cost more than $1100. Concert cancelled, now the site keeps saying postponed in order to keep my money after I requested refund, disputed it through Bank of America credit card who will also not refund my money. Now I am stuck without money and not service provided. This company is a fraudulent greedy company who is now being sued under class action suit and I suppose I will be in the class action payment if any. Meanwhile Vivid Seats is enjoying the use of my 1100 dollars and me and my children will not have our Christmas present enjoyed together as planned. Do not do business with this company, They are fraudulent."
"We purchased Tickets to go see Willie Nelson in August. The event was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Vivid Seats rescheduled the event again later this year 2020. We now find out that the event is rescheduled for October 2021. There is no way I can Plan on an event that far in advance and ask for a refund. These tickets were over $300 each X 4. Plus the ridiculous fees they charge. They absolutely will not issue any refund and only say, ""Well you can try to resell these tickets but if you do you can’t get your money until 10 days after the event."" I WOULD NEVER EVER UTILIZE VIVID SEATS FOR ANYTHING. THEY ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT ISSUE REFUNDS. PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM. They have tons of small print and are total rip off."
"Let me start by saying the only reason I gave this company 1 star is because it was required. I wouldn't even give them half a star if it was option. I purchased tickets in May for a baseball event that was expected to take place in June. However, it was made clear by all of the sports media that this event would be canceled."
If anyone wants a refund and there are a lot of you who do from Vivid Seats you need to file a complaint received Better Business Bureau in Chicago. They will take it to vivid seats. That's the only way you are going to see any money. If you do not do that it is your own fault. Mine took 6mos!
"Frustrated with Vivid Seats, they will not refund tickets for The Rolling Stones -No Filters Tour. Vivid Seats made billions on event tickets prior to the Pandemic and now they will not refund people their money. They are making more money on interest from hoarding people’s money."
"After a concert was canceled due to Covid, they are refusing to refund our money. They offer a credit that we don’t want, but will not discuss a refund. Actually, they won’t “discuss” anything. Will only communicate via email and it’s just a standard form letter restating their credit policy. NEVER buy concert tickets from Vivid Seats!"
"August 28, 2020. We ordered tickets thru Vivid Seats to a Letter Kenny show late 2019. The show was scheduled for April 2020. Since Covid19 hit all shows have either been postponed or canceled. I have written many emails to Vivid Seats asking for a refund (it's now August, 4 months later than original show date) and no refund or rescheduling of show. Vivid Seats claims that they only refund once the show has been canceled - but the show has been postponed with a TBD date for 4 months so it doesn't look like it will be rescheduled."
"If you're looking for the worst company on the planet, you've found them. They will hang up on you, disconnect chats, and ignore your emails because they simply hate customers and enjoy treating people like garbage."
"Vivid Seats does NOT have a ""100% Buyer Guarantee"" policy ""designed to give you full peace-of-mind, safety, and security."" These are their words and they are an outright lie. Taylor Swift canceled all her 2020 Lover Fest shows and stated she would be rescheduling them sometime in 2021. Because she could potentially be rescheduling them, they have classified the concerts as ""postponed"" vs. ""canceled"" in the ticket world. However, all media outlets have reported her 2020 shows were canceled which is what the average consumer would understand the status to be. "
"Was notified that my event was canceled and was told that I had 7 days to request a refund. I got on their website 2 days later requesting a refund. 2 months later I contacted them saying I haven't received it yet. They informed me that I didn't request it in time. I had a feeling this was going to happen, I had other events canceled thru other companies and was issued a refund automatically, will never do business with Vivid again."
"I purchased tickets to two events before the pandemic. These events were canceled eventually and Vivid Seats sent out emails asking to request a refund if desired. Instead of issuing a refund, they issued a credit for one pair of tickets I ordered and are trying to keep the other money (over 700) by telling Paypal (I filed a dispute) that they issued a refund. This refund is nonexistent except in their falsified files. They lied and said they never received my requests for refunds and there is no way to speak to anyone unless you are trying to purchase tickets (they want to talk to you for that). This has been a month-long ordeal! I advise anyone who wants tickets to events to go to anyone else, even if they charge more!!! You will not get these crooks to answer the phone or respond to emails. Save yourself! You've been warned."
"Like many others, the show I bought tickets to was postponed due to coronavirus. I bought tickets for my family (4 of us) before the virus was a thing. The show was postponed for 14 months. Late August of 2021. Even though I purchased the insurance, they still refuse to refund me. This company is absolute garbage. I've filed a charge reversal with my bank. Hopefully they can take care of this for me. I will NEVER use this trash company again. You shouldn't either."
"My event was canceled. I requested a refund on the same day. Two weeks later I emailed them requesting an update, and I’m told my request was outside the 7 day window. Impossible to speak w/ a rep."
Roger Waters cancelled his tour for 2020 and Vividseats.com will not return the funds!! They keep stating it is postponed and that they will refund when cancelled however ** states the entire 2020 tour isn't happening this year. If it happens in 2021 that would be the 2021 Tour and so the 2020 Tour is cancelled. They refuse to refund and Paypal will not help due to purchasing the tickets over 180 days ago.
"Never would I ever purchase tickets from here. There are so many other alternatives and I will always use another company from here on out. Save yourself the headache and use SeatGeek or TicketMaster or a scalper off the street. We have tried talking to a manager and was told ""they don't take calls"" yet they boast about 100% customer satisfaction guaranteed. Let's just say as a customer I am 0% satisfied. Purchase tickets anywhere else, buy here and you WILL regret it."
"Our event was cancelled due to covid back in March. I received an email saying someone would reach out re an option for a refund or credit(never happened). Contacted them my selves and was told to be patient. Given the pandemic their call volumes were high but rest assured they were working on my refund. I was patient, in fact I waited months then finally reached out again to follow up. I was told that I had not requested my cash refund within 7 days and that I’d only be offered a credit. I showed proof of my earlier conversations with customer service and asked to speak with a manager because I really needed the refund but was ignored twice. Will never waste my money on this shady company again and I don’t recommend anyone else to."
"Do NOT use this company! I purchased 4 tickets to Oregon vs Ohio State Football game. Not only were the surcharges more than the actual tickets, they are refusing to offer refund. I received a response via email that they were aware that the game has been canceled and I will be officially notified on how to request a refund. I waited a couple weeks then got on their website and chatted with someone and they told me, ""No the game is still on"" even though all you had to do was Google it and every single article said it was canceled. They chatted me that the other agent was incorrect and they didn't want to argue with me about it. I said, ""Fine, I will wait for the official email."" Not only the game was canceled, the whole Pac 12 season was canceled. "
I would just like to state we purchased tickets last year and due to this Covid pandemic the concert was cancelled and rescheduled. Twice. It is now next November 2021. We are unable to attend and under these circumstances they will NOT refund my money. I lost 150$. Do not use them! Crooks!
"This is easy, I paid $1400 for seats to the Billie Eilish concert back in Oct, the concert was canceled, well I've been waiting for a long time, just so I can say I work with them, so now I'm done. I want my money back, they never sent me anything, now they ask if I had insurance, I asked insurance so you can rip me off, now that I don't have insurance I'm screwed, they told me today they're keeping my money... RIP OFF COMPANY, DO BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE PEOPLE."
"Purchased tickets. The site clearly stated I will receive my tickets by 8/6/2020. The concert was rescheduled for 2021, now in the app it states I'll get them by 8/12/21. Over a year! Rep was no help."
"I purchased tickets to an event prior to the pandemic. The event has been canceled. Vivid Seats is refusing to refund my purchase. They are saying that the event has been ""postponed"" which is completely inaccurate and just their way to withhold a refund. During these trying economic times I would like to think there would be some compassion and they would not withhold refunds behind something completely made up. Please do not support this company. It is a SCAM."
"I received an email saying my Alabama Football Event for September 2020 was canceled and to request a refund within 7 days. Starting reaching out to these people on 7/31/20 and it's now 8/5/20 and I'm still unable to get ahold of anyone in Customer Service! I've requested live chats, only to be re-routed to nothing. It never allowed me the option to request refund. The only time someone will answer is if they think you're calling to order tickets. So, I called that number two times, explaining to the same customer service rep I wasn't calling to order but unable to get ahold of anyone regarding a refund. Both times the same rep said, ""Let me get someone who can help you,"" but no one ever came on. As a matter of fact, both times, the phone rang three times and I was automatically disconnected!!! "
"I just noticed that all of the reviews for Vivid Seats are before March 13 when most of the US shut down due to the Coronavirus pandemic. For the last 5 months, many others and I have filed for refunds for cancelled events, which is required in the event of a cancellation of an event, per their own Terms & Conditions. I visited this site previously and found many horrible reviews about customer service, poor ethics, and trouble with refunds. It seems that either Consumer Affairs or Vivid Seats has moderated the reviews and choose to only show you (the public) the good reviews. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER CONCERT/EVENT TICKET THROUGH VIVID SEATS!"
"I bought tickets in January for my first Braves game in April. Then the pandemic hit. The last email I received from Vivid said if my game was cancelled they would contact me for a refund or I could take a credit with an extra 10% or something. So I waited for them to contact me and they didn’t so I finally emailed them and now they say I had 7 days for a refund!! I said, ""What, I was waiting for you to Contact me! 7 days from when? It took me forever to find someone to go to a game with me and there will not be any games this year for people to attend and who knows what will Happen next year. So I’m Out $400 for nothing during a pandemic!! Way to go! While other companies are trying to help people you are screwing them over!!"" Expensive lesson learned. At 63 years old I’m Still learning the hard way!!"
"I purchased two tickets with insurance in March before things got really bad with the virus for a concert in June. When they were offering the insurance its advertizing was misleading about the virus. The June concert was rescheduled for July 29th. I was sent a notification my tickets were going to be sent to me by July 27th. Well, to say the least the insurance was not honored but VIVID SEATS never sent me my tickets. When I complained - they said they were not responsible for getting me my tickets! Their site says 100% guarantee which is a lie. So if their insurance does not honor anything and they do not have to honor getting me my tickets, what do they do??? This is a scam and rip off!"
"Vivid Seats is a scam. They advertise on their site for you to sell your tickets then when you do they say you cannot sell mobile tickets, the exact tickets their ads and website buttons enticed me to sell, then you call they will tell this verbatim and try to charge you again for your tickets in order to honor your tickets sold on their website. They use their patrons as ponzies to sell more tickets."
"Vivid changed policy on cancellations of concert tickets, we purchased Bon Jovi tickets and they have kept our hard earned money, over $700.00, it now sits in their ""rewards"" program. We wanted a cash refund on our card."
"This company is horrible. I bought tickets to a concert in vegas for 4 June, of course it was cancelled due to Covid. I was suppose to have received an email with the option of getting a refund, never received it, which I've read on here that it happened to a lot of people. So I got a credit that had to be used within 6 months. Used the credit for the same concert in Boston, supposedly the concert has now been ""rescheduled"" for NEXT YEAR!!!! 14 months from now and the group hasn't even posted their 2021 concert schedule yet!!! Of course I'm getting the ""it was in the terms and conditions and as long as they keep rescheduling we can't refund your money""! "
I ordered tickets to open day for the Colorado Rockies game that was suppose to happen at the beginning of April. Due to COVID that did not happen. In June I called Chase Bank to dispute the charge and the gave me a temporary refund for 700 dollars. Vivid seats came back and said the event was not cancelled and therefore could not give the refund. 
"Got an email May 6th that my event was canceled and that I could receive a refund or credit, but if I chose refund it would be unknown when they could refund me. I responded back on May 6th saying I wanted my refund, not credits. They didn't respond so, I wrote them again on the 9th and I received an email pretty much saying that it was unsure when they can refund me. It is now July 10th and finally got through to a real person and they said since I did not get back to them in 7 days I can't get a refund. I explained that I have emails saved showing I wrote them back. Now they want me to forward them those emails. Which I just did. However they have stopped responding for now."
"I purchased Cardinal baseball tickets. The games were canceled because of Covid-19. They sent a notification. Said I had to answer in 7 days which I didn't see until after the 7 days. I tried several times call and email with no response. This week I received correspondence that I will not receive a refund and I have 6 months from May 2020 to spend the money. Well there are no games scheduled for the year. So they are saying, ""Tough luck. You lose it all."" This is poor business practice. Would not recommend them at all."
"Bought NBA tickets March 2020, not knowing Covid-19 would peak in US at this time. A few weeks after my purchase, all games were postponed. Wanting a refund, it was nearly impossible to get ahold of someone and when I did, I was told I would not be receiving a refund but my tickets were good till a rescheduled date or 100% buyers guarantee if event was canceled."
"I purchased tickets to an event that was cancelled due to COVID. Vivid sent an email offering a refund but only gave 7 days which is a direct contrast to their original policy. Don’t trust or buy Vivid. Their customer service contact line doesn’t work properly so it’s nearly impossible to get through to anyone. When finally able to talk to a person they said “Sorry, I am the manager and I can’t do anything to help with your refund. You will have to use the credit. You had 7 days to dispute.”"
"I had purchased concert tickets this year on 1/26/2020. With the COVID-19 pandemic that is currently happening, our concert got canceled. On 3/21/2020, I received an email stating that the event was canceled. The email gave customers two options;"
"Do not buy any tickets via Vivid Seats! After my event was cancelled due to Corona Virus, I spent the last 3 months calling about my refund. They told me I would received a call when they are ready to refund my money.... Find out they sent an email who looks like the 100 of emails they send you as advertisement saying that if you do not respond to that email withing the next 7 days you will not get your money back! I tried to call them several time... they never pick up the phone!!! Shame on them!! And now it is too late to get a refund! They send me a credit that has an expiration date of 18 months... knowing that no sports events or concerts are allowed to happen here in New York for a while!! Shame on them! They stole my money!!!"
"I bought Kenny Chesney concert tickets through VIVID SEATS. When the concert was cancelled , then rescheduled for next year, I was looking into getting a refund. As I was reading carefully through the emails I had received, I noticed where it said that when you print out your tickets, it may not have the correct name on them or the correct price I paid...what the heck?!?I wish I had taken the extra few minutes to read reviews on this ticket broker!  :("
Tickets purchased for a June 15th baseball game. Game cancelled due to COVID-19. VIVID would not / did not refund or credit my credit card $400. Loss. Their 100% guarantee is false. VIVID offered to help me resale my tickets to a game that was cancelled.
"After reading the many many reviews of how terrible experiences have been during the pandemic with regards to Vivid Seats refunding money, I am happy to provide yet another horrible review of this company based on my awful experience, which echoes that of many people providing reviews. I purchased tickets to two separate Zac Brown Band shows - one in Nashville (April 25) and one in Massachusetts (May 29). I had made purchases totaling $1750, which is no small amount."
Paid approximately 350.00 for two tickets. The show was cancelled. They took my money in 10 seconds. Its been over 8 months now and am still getting the runaround. Do not buy tickets from this company.
I purchased 5 tickets to a Kenney Chesney concert In Lake Tahoe which was rescheduled To a date that 3 of us cannot attend. The artist says on his website we can get full refunds If the new date does not work. Vivid won’t give me my money back. I was only asking for a refund for 3 of the 5 tickets to be refunded. They are thieves.
"Due to the pandemic our show was cancelled. Vivid offered store credit or cash. We chose the store credit. The store credit was supposed to last until September. With the pandemic getting worse we decided we would like our refund. Vivid told us that they could not give us our money back, but instead extend the date to March 2022 for us to sit in close proximity in a crowded theater. We’ve had family members who we are close to die due to Covid as well as a loss of employment. We just want our money back for a show that is now too dangerous of times to see in a tiny theater. "
"I ordered tickets from a concert at the beginning of the year and it was canceled due to COVID. The company will not give me a refund, only store credit which expires and is useless since big events cannot occur due to COVID. Horrible customer service and you cannot even get through on the phone lines. This was my first time using this company and it will definitely be my last. Do not use them."
"Purchased two baseball tickets and the game was cancelled due to the pandemic. Company is refusing to refund the amount of the ticket & trying to force me to take a credit. The company sent out an email stating the consumer didn’t have to take any action on getting a refund due to Covid. A customer service agent also told me they would handle refunds once games were 100% cancelled. Now customer service is going back on their word and trying to blame me, the consumer, for not following up with them when they explicitly told me they would handle on their end. It came down to me disputing the charge with my bank. The true character comes out in a company during times like this & I would not recommend their services. I even purchased the insurance which isn’t covering the ticket prices either! Two thumbs down for this company."
"I purchased Disney on Ice tickets for 3 in February. When COVID-19 became more intense I called on March 19th to cancel my tickets. I was told it wasn't a problem and my money would be refunded in 4 to 6 weeks. This is the confirmation of this from the email confirming this. Disney on Ice: Worlds of Enchantment CANCELLED (Sat. Apr 25, 2020 1:00 PM). Order #**"
"I purchased tickets to the Kenny Chesney concert on May 7th. Due to COVID, the concert was postponed. The VividSeats website clearly states (I have the screenshots) the only time you can get a refund for your tickets is when the concert has been cancelled. WELL, Kenny Chesney came out with new concert dates and unfortunately my venue didn't make the cut. I called to get a refund because I can't drive 8 hours to Tampa for a concert. I was told by the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT, that they don't consider the concert cancelled. He suggested I monitored my email for further updates. "
Purchased 2 tickets to Andre Ruii concert-cancelled due to coronavirus but Vivid Seats refuse to refund ticket price. American Express refuse to help. I don’t know what recourse is left other than hopefully warn consumers of unethical company.
"I was planning on going to see the Blue-Jays with my family in March, but it was cancelled due to covid-19. Vivid Seats refuses to refund any of the money for the tickets for a cancelled event. I could have really used that money to support my family during COVID-19. :( Please be careful using VIVID Seats, there is no buyer protection."
"I bought tickets to watch a basketball game while on holiday in USA from UK at a cost of over $440. Due to the situation with Covid-19 my holiday was cancelled and so was the basketball game. Vivid Seats have refused to refund my money and have issued a store credit instead which expires on 16-Dec-2020. As I don’t live in the USA this is useless. I contacted Vivid Seats customer service explaining my situation and asking if they could agree to a full cash refund instead. Their reply was, ""We cannot alter the compensation you received from us."" So basically they have stolen my money. Would I recommend Vivid Seats - HELL NO."
"Vivid Seats is not processing any refunds for cancelled concerts due to COVID-19. My 15 year-old daughter bought two tickets to the Taylor Swift concert with money she had been saving for months, and these thieves are keeping it. I repeat, do not ever use this service. I am hoping they are sued out of existence and their company management is sent to prison."
The Rolling Stones Postponed because of COVID-19. Because they did not cancel they offer NO REFUND. A good 4-months and The Rolling Stones have still not Rescheduled. Which means NO REFUND. Ticketmaster does offer a refund. Next time I will buy from Ticketmaster. @vividseats #neveragain #BLM #BoycottRollingStones #boycottVividSeats
"Due to COVID-19, my event was cancelled. Since March 26th, I had been emailing VIVID how to claim my refund. They finally emailed me May 30th giving me 7 days to respond to the refund policy. I responded right away on June 1st. They sent a 2nd email trying to talk me into taking the customer credit, I still responded that I wanted a refund and they denied me the refund because ""I needed to keep responding to additional emails"" even though I already told them what I wanted and they have a ""100% refund policy- guarantee""...Save yourself the trouble and go through another vendor! VIVID SEATS sucks and are liars!"
"Bought tickets for Marlins baseball game. Game was cancelled and no refund. They claim I waited after the 7 day grace period. No way. They stalled and and stalled. Been over 3 months. Do not deal with these people. They take your money and won't stand behind their ""guarantee"". Even Capital One wouldn't help."
"I ordered 3 tickets to the Toronto Raptors game totaling $260.00. They were for March 16th- right when all games were canceled due to Covid 19. They said the game was “postponed” not “canceled’ so I could not receive my money back. It is now June 12th, I paid for 3 tickets and never got to go to the game. Furthermore, I don’t live in Toronto. I was going to be there that weekend. Even if it is “rescheduled”, which obviously now it will not be, I most likely would not be able to go."
"I bought tickets to an NBA game February 3, 2020. I live in an apartment building and UPS was supposed to deliver my tickets to me directly and get my signature. Vivid Seats states that the delivery was made and UPS had received a signature indicating that we got our tickets. When seeing the signature on the tracker it said WYP my initials are SSS. Also my fiance and I were home all day and nobody came to the door. CCTV footage shows a UPS guy didn't even come to my door all day that day. Filed a dispute initially for not receiving my ticket via chase, and because I was out of town and was not able to respond to a letter my dispute ruled in the merchant's favor. I re-opened my dispute.  "
"Stay away from these Crooks, they will not even talk to you regarding money back for Covid 19 Events that canceled. They are Thieves and need to be reported to the Attorney Generals office which I am trying to do. DO NOT BUY TICKETS FROM THEM EVER!!!"
"I recently bought tickets for a Boston game and I live in Jacksonville Fl. I had to purchase plane tickets, and a hotel just for this one particular game. Once COVID 19 came on I was told the game was being delayed and to wait it out. I contacted them several times over a few months begging for a refund. Once the game was cancelled they refused to give me a refund, providing me credit. They don't seem to understand I don't want credit, I want a refund. They use a computer to talk to you over chat and will not answer their phones. Never again will I use these crooks and will tell everyone not to use them. The worst company I have EVER dealt with."
"Their customer services does not respond. Their buyer protection agreement is a joke. They give you 7 days to respond to them, but you can't get through on phone and they don't respond via email. The next response you get from them is an email saying you missed the 7 day response time and now you have a ""credit"". I have not question in my mind Covid-19 will kill this company and a credit isn't worth the paper it's written on. They are stealing $480 from me. Don't do business with them."
Tried to contact Vivid Seats to receive a refund for a show that was canceled due to Covid 19. Vivid Seats only allows contact via messaging. Vivid Seats refused to refund our money and referenced an email that we did not receive so we couldn’t respond. Vivid seats will not allow you to talk to anyone except for the phone bank reps through messaging and said managers can not talk to customers. This is totally a sham outfit.
"I purchased tickets to a concert that was cancelled due to COVID. Vivid Seats emailed letting me know the event was cancelled and that I would be getting a full cash refund back to my credit card in 2-4 weeks. About 5 weeks later, they sent another email saying I had to contact them in 7 days in order to receive the refund they already promised, and if I did not, then they would just provide a credit toward a future purchase with them. I did contact them immediately to request the refund and was told I would get one but they could not say when that would happen. I promptly filed a dispute with my credit card company that has been going on for about 45 days now. Vivid Seats is fighting tooth and nail to avoid the refund that they promised. Time will tell if my credit card company supports me on this."
I paid for tickets to a Reds game and Sammy Hagar concert. Both were canceled due to the covid pandemic. I requested a refund for both--totaling over $600. They are offering me a credit--no refund. @×!
I purchased tickets to a concert that was postponed and they cancelled due to COVID-19. I requested a refund and was told I missed the window for a refund. This company is a rip off. I want my money!!!
"I bought Aerosmith tickets 911.42. It was 1st postponed. Being that amount I put a dispute to cc which got refused. Concert is cancelled. Tried to dispute again. No can do!! Refund policy clearly states once cancelled you're entitled a full refund. Nothing states whether you dispute the charge or not. I have a 911.42 credit  expiring 11/30/2020 which they won't extend in writing. ""Oh just call them and they'll extend it."" Right! One day I was on hold for 4 hours and nothing was resolved. Called twice after that. Nope. So I decide to try their chat. After an hour she says, ""Call customer service"" and hangs up! NEVER NEVER buy tickets from VIVID SEATS."
I purchased tickets in December 19 for an event in March 20. Due to Covid-19 that event was canceled. I was emailed on 6/1 offering a refund within 7 days. I contacted Vivid on 6/1 and never got a response. So on 6/9 I contacted them again and finally someone reached out and said it was past the 7 days. All I could receive was a credit. However I explained that I did reach out within minutes after receiving the email on 6/1. The customer service rep said they understood but they could not refund me anything. I was only receiving the credit.
This company is being sued. They lie and are not ethical. Per Better Business Bureau - “we highly recommend you not use this company. They have proven to not operate ethically.” I suggest staying clear from this company. Once you order all you can talk to are bots. The bot will say “can’t find your order number” when it is the exact order number Vivid Seats supplied me... Do not use Vivid Seats!
"This ""company"" is a bunch of crooks!! I purchased tickets for the Stadium tour in January 2020 for July. Due to the pandemic, it was postponed. Let me emphasize POSTPONED WITH NO RESCHEDULED DATE!! When I emailed Vivid Seats to get a refund, because, again, there is no rescheduled date, it says TBD. I was told I couldn't get a refund because the tour wasn't ""cancelled"". If you look at their refund policy, it's been updated as of May 2020. This should be considered breach of contract, anybody who purchased tickets prior to May, should be bound by those terms and conditions. It says a lot for this ""company"" to change their terms and conditions in the middle of a pandemic!!"
We purchased tickets to a Dallas Mavericks game for our anniversary. We paid extra money for insurance on top of the ticket price. When the virus hit and the game was canceled we called them and they refused to refund the money. The game is canceled and they are profiting off of customers that paid for literally nothing. This companies customer service is trash and they are not helpful at all. I’ll never use this company again or recommend them.
Had tickets for a sporting event. Event finally cancelled. They would not refund money stating I did not respond in a week from an email they sent that I did not receive. If I could rate them 0 stars I would. They are taking advantage of people due to COVID to rip them off.
"BEWARE - Vivid Seats does not stand behind their customers. Buffett was rescheduled to August of 2021 and I can not attend. Live Nation refunded my money. However Vivid Seats refused to refund my parking lot ticket. They told me I could sell it myself. This was not their problem, they said. Horrible customer service! I won't be buying tickets from them in the future."
"During an initial call to Vivid Seats to request a refund soon after the concert was canceled, I was told that I would receive a full cash refund. I waited a month and no refund was issued. I have now spent the last four hours on the phone trying to get my cash refund. I have been told by three contracted phone bank workers that I was not going to receive my cash refund because I didn't respond to an ""email"" within a so called seven day limit. I tried to explain that I never received this email which the representative kept referring to. Each worker kept repeating the same scripted response to my request. I was hung up on three times. I want my money back. I need it now."
Purchased tickets from Vivid. When the event was cancelled they refused a refund. Offered essentially store credit. I could use a voucher for a later event. Even after numerous emails and texts they refused. They are crooks. Lack integrity and honesty. Would choose a different service that will stand behind their customers.
Refund for canceled event was given as a credit for 6months which is not in accordance with Vivid’s own refund policy! They are trying to use this clause in order to screw customers or just Hispanic customers.
"In regards to a cancelled concert due to the pandemic. I contacted them numerous times before, the day of and within their seven day time frame with no response for days. When they finally did respond they claimed I was outside their time frame. How could I be when I have all the emails for before, during and after. I still want my refund and there is no response to that. Cannot recommend them"
"After submitting complaints with the BBB in Illinois, Attorney General Offices in both CA and IL, I received an email from the BBB and shortly after an email from Vivid Seats indicating they will refund my full amount. I checked my bank statement and they have refunded the entire amount. I believe going the BBB IL really helped me get my refund. This process took from 5.28.20-6.7.20."
"In Jan of 2020, purchased 2 tickets (4 day pass) for for Country Music Festival for June 3 2020. After paying over $900 dollars via CCard on the phone, they proceeded to tell me that the seller will mail the tickets up to 5/28/20. I told the C/S person that we are Seniors and would be driving from NJ to Nashville TN and would depart 6/1, and that is cutting it close. They guaranteed us that we will have it in hand on or before 5/28. So basically we were stuck. Then the Covid 19 outbreak and we received an email that the event will not be happening. The most incredibly misleading statement was that its rescheduled for the following year! Ha!! The event happens every June and has for numerous years, so they got us good!! If it's rescheduled/ it's not refundable."
"Vivid Seats has the worst customer service I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Their buyer guarantee is supposed to protect you, your purchases, and your money; however, when an issue arises or an event is cancelled (due to the venue, artist, or possibly a global pandemic in my case) they refuse to issue a refund."
"Lets cut to the chase. COVID-19 has taken a terrible toll on the Entertainment Industry. There is no negating that. VIVID, like many other companies have undoubtedly been hit hard with the cancellation of shows. It is in these challenging times where a company has to make a decision. Do we do what's right by our customers, or do we do what's in our best interest. Unfortunately, VIVID sided with the latter, in a horrible fashion that included a double negative email chain, a Customer Service IVR that leads nowhere and time limit on collecting your well earned refund. Let me explain..."
"I purchased $750 MLB opening day tickets from Vivid for my favorite team on my birthday. I even purchased the ""100% guarantee."" Both the MLB and other ticket internet companies are listing this event as being cancelled and offering refunds. When I shared that the event was cancelled and refunds were available, they refused to acknowledge the evidence I tried to share. This has been a very frustrating experience. I've sent three emails, chatted twice and now I've been on hold for over an hour waiting to speak with someone in person. Since I purchased these tickets in March, the company has been completely unresponsive to my requests for help, stating ""as soon as we hear something, we'll let you know."" I'm still waiting."
"DO NOT UNDER any circumstances buy tickets from this site, unless you want to LOSE all of your money. This website speaks about 100% guarantee, the only 100% guarantee you have is you will LOSE your money if the concert doesn't happen. They told us we could get a refund, ""Don't worry, you don't even have to do a thing..."" Just to confirm, I emailed them 3x to tell confirm, ""Yes I want a refund, please."" I even called them and they said ""my refund was process on 11-Mar-20, however, 2-4 weeks to see in Paypal/bank."" Ok I have patience. However, in the meantime, I received SEVERAL credit option emails... See they TRY to get you to do a ""credit"", most companies I would do a credit no problem, but this one, who knows if the credits will be worth anything. "
"I Purchased tickets in Aug of 2019 to the Lauren Daigle concert schedule May 2020. I changed my mind about the tickets and decided to sell them and was told I would could place on site for resale which I did. The tickets were sold, confirmed and I sent the tickets back on March 8th and I was told I would receive $297 within 7 days however, I never received my money. In the mean time Corona Virus happened and with all the concerts cancelling it has been impossible to reach them. The concert has now been rescheduled for NEXT year 2021 in March and I received general email letting me know this. I once again tried to call and after holding for 3 hrs and 55 min I reached someone who informed me that the policy has changed and I would not be paid for my sold tickets until 7 days after the event next year. I asked how could they keep my money as now they have been paid twice for the same tickets and I was told ""this is our policy."" "
"We purchased 17 parking passes for an event in March that due to COVID-19 was cancelled. When the event was cancelled, we received an email from Vivid Seats advising that we could have a '120% Vivid Rewards Cash Credit' (but we had to respond in 72 hours) or 'Full Refund' (no further action required). Obviously we did not respond expecting a full refund after the promised 2-4 weeks. After noticing the refund had not been received, I went online to find out if there was maybe a delay, or some kind of explanation - no luck."
"I purchased 4 tickets to the 2020 CMA Fest, with a money back guarantee if it was cancelled. Well it was cancelled due to Covid and I called for my refund. They told me it was rescheduled and couldn’t give my money back, I informed them it was cancelled per the CMA website and it is an annual event. They said I had to take tickets for 2021 and I told them I didn’t want them for 2021, as it is different artists and shows, not to mention I purchased for 2020. I have emailed and chatted with several agents at Vivid and they are constantly changing their policies. I purchased with a 100% guarantee and I want a refund. "
"Do NOT let Vividseats win, fight with your credit card company, when the credit card company refuses a credit don't take no for an answer. Keep fighting, that's what I'm doing. They have said no refund to me several times, get the branch manager involved if your credit card is from your bank or credit union. Also contact your Attorney General's office and file a complaint. One complaint they will ignore but all the victims they will listen, file in your home state and Illinois. We need to fight these people! Don't forget how they treated you and don't ever use their service again. Read how the ticket market works. It's a scandal. Good luck and FIGHT them. Don't let them win. Patrick"
"While Vivid Seats says that they are a 100% Buyer satisfaction guarantee, during the pandemic their service was terrible. Our event was cancelled and they claim to have sent an email notifying us of the cancellation and offering a refund for only 7 days. However, I never received such email. When the ""refund offer"" expired, they sent an 2nd email that indicated that my account had been credited for the purchase. At this time, I immediately got online and researched how to best contact the company."
"Never buy tickets from Vivid Seats. We bought ticket for Miami Open, and the event was canceled because of COVID 19. They sent an email 2 months ago that they will refund the money and they never did. They even answered my bank saying won't be refund, when we disputed the transactions. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER BUY TICKETS FROM VIVID SEATS!!!!"
"I purchased a ticket for the Cincinnati Jazz Festival, the jazz festival is an event that is held every year. They will not refund my money for the cancellation as stated in their policy. Instead they are using the next event in 2021 (which will take place regardless, as it do every year) as a “postpone”. I purchased six tickets for two days for a total of almost $2000, I was told I cannot get my money back because the event was “postponed”. This is a scam! This is a annual event! There is no guarantee I will get a flight or hotel for next year. I am very disappointed in this company and will never buy from them again."
"Bought tickets to RATM concert that was ""rescheduled"" because of pandemic. Here in Cali. There wont be any concerts until 2021 but Vivid Seats is still selling tickets like there will be. Finally the band decided to grant refunds for those who bought tickets to their show, but vivid isnt granting the refunds. Even though the band RATM says to on their website. I'm looking into the class action lawsuit."
"My event was cancelled in March and I was sent an email on 3/13/2020 stating I would receive a full refund to my bank account within 2-4 weeks. Here we are 5/15/2020 and still no refund. No one is answering their chat service or phone lines. I waited on the phone for 6 hours yesterday and several hours so far today. I have bought from Vivid Seats many times, but never again."
"I bought tickets to a concert months ago. I found out I couldn't make it later due to a scheduling conflict. They state on the website that you can put the tickets up for sale. This the norm practice for all ticket sellers- No problem, right? Well I tried and it was blocked due to the popularity of the venue and their loyalty to large resellers, not the average customer. They told me to post for sale somewhere else. Now due to the COVID-19- since the artist only postponed, I still can't get my money back despite the economical hardship we all are going through. No date in sight. It's sad that a few Artists hold out indefinitely and the ticket sellers do not do the right thing by us either. I don't know what my schedule will be like a year from now when someone finally decides what the hell they want to do. I don't even know if it will be safe to take my daughter anyway."
Do not purchase tickets from Vivid Seats for any reason. My concert was rescheduled for a year later and it will now be during my honeymoon. Contacted them for a refund and they told me to simply resell the tickets.
"We purchased tickets to an event that was cancelled from COVID-19. Vivid seats compiled a lengthy email indicating that they would provide all customers with a 110% refund to their account on vivid seats. With the difficulties of teaching my children from home while also working from home, I missed the bottom few sentences that stated I had 7 days to request a full refund."
Purchased 4 seats to a spring training Philly Vs Pirate game. This game was cancelled due to Covid 19. Requested a refund to my credit card and did that within the 72 hour time. I was notified by email that I would get credit in 2 to 4 weeks. 5 weeks later I was sent an email asking for the method of refund. I did not see this email. Besides I had already said credit my credit card and received a confirmation of that.
Do NOT do business with Vivid.. They're crooks and have hands down the WORST customer service. Their 100% buyer guarantee is a lie. My event was canceled and I fought them for 2 months and then instead of refunding my money as I requested multiple times. They get me a credit and are refusing to give me my refund. I have spent numerous occasions on hold for over 2 hrs just for them to refuse my request of a refund. I have saved all correspondence with vivid and I have contacted legal counsel.
Vivid Seats is a horrible company! I bought me and my husband tickets to WWE Wrestlemania 36. It was suppose to be our anniversary date. Due to Covid-19 the WWE CANCELED. I received an email stating that as long as all I wanted back was my money I wouldn’t need to take any steps. I waited a month and still didn’t have my money back. I received a second email stating that there was nothing else needed to be done for a cash refund. I even bought the protection plan to ensure my refund.
I purchased tickets and the tournament was canceled due to the Covid 19 pandemic. They will not issue a refund. They say I have 18 months to use the credit. It sounds like it will be a long time before college sports will be back.
"I purchased tickets to an event that was to be held in Cincinnati, Ohio October 2020. Due to Covid-19 the event has been cancelled (no rescheduling). I requested a refund on April 21, 2020 and asked when I would receive a refund. They told me that due to Covid-19 they were unable to give me any date. Fast forward to May 8, 2020 when I check my Vivid Seats account I see I was give a credit. I reached out to customer service and they said since I didn't respond within 7 days to an email sent (which I never received) on April 30, 2020 there was nothing they could do. I sent them a screenshot of my request for a refund from April 21, 2020 and they said there was nothing they could do. This company is a scam!"
"In February, I purchased tickets from a ticket vendor company called Vivid Seats in order to take my son to his very first concert: Post Malone, in Ontario, California at the Toyota Arena on March 17, 2020. I purchased very expensive tickets as a birthday gift, which totaled $700.00. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 virus, and state guidelines, I received an email from Vivid on March 13, 2020 informing me that the event had been CANCELED. I was given the option of either 1) 120% store credit or 2) a full refund. If I elected to accept the store credit, I had 72 hours to reply to email. If I wanted a refund, I was informed that I did not have to respond and that a refund would appear in my bank account automatically within two-four weeks. I opted for a refund; therefore, I did nothing and waited."
Purchased tickets to an event that was canceled due to covid-19.... not postponed! Received a email that I would receive a refund or credit and that I didn’t need to do anything else to receive my full refund. I waited 4 weeks and sent a email asking about time of refund and if there was anything I needed to do to ensure my refund. I received a email stating I didn’t need to do anything and that it would just take time due to the mass amount of refunds being processed. Never received anything else from them. I did however receive a ** credit I didn’t want and asked to not receive and have spent over a hour on hold to talk to a live person after the person behind the live chat exited out of the chat when given proof that I contacted them about my refund. I’ve also sent several more emails and have yet to hear anything back. This company is a low life disgrace and should not be sued. They lie and change policies after sending you information so they can keep your money. A class action suit needs to happen.
"Our concert was canceled over a month ago and I still have not received my refund of my money. They keep coming up with excuses to hold my money and build interest. I will never use them again. I put more than enough hours, calls, time etc trying to get my money back. It was a nightmare."
"I purchased tickets back in January for Mother's Day game 5/10/20. I take my mom every year. With the pandemic spreading across the globe, the game is not going to happen yet I have yet to receive a refund. I contacted them on 5/5 inquiring about the Mother's Day game which we all know is not going to happen. They will not give a refund because the Dodgers organization has yet to send any details about the game or if it's postponed. They did say if it's cancelled they will give me refund but right now everything is TBD. I let them know that I need the $ and not worried about the game anymore. "
"We ordered tickets to the Kenny Chesney concert in January - totaling roughly $675. Event originally scheduled for 5/23 - the concert is indefinitely postponed.  Ticket master is issuing refunds, Vivid Seats will not. Nor will they commit to when they will issue the refund. They can retain the funds until the event is officially cancelled. If it stays indefinitely postponed, they indefinitely hold on to your money.  My bad for ordering through a third party - will never make that mistake again!"
"I bought tickets to a show suppose to be coming up in July but because of the recent covid-19 pandemic, the show was rescheduled for next YEAR! $425 tickets and they won't cancel or refund my purchase. Obviously, a year out is way too long for them to hold onto that money especially considering the current hardship. I 100% suggest you buy your tickets somewhere else. Life happens and they only care about keeping your money. Not to mention they have really high fees."
"I was requesting a refund from Vivid Seats (VS) for our Eagle tickets due to a second postponement totaling 1-1/2 years. Was told refunds were only available upon cancellation. The Covid-19 has impacted everyone in some manner, however l’m concerned VS might be using this to their advantage with a delay tactic. My wife and l will remember companies that have weathered this storm and treat customers fairly. With that said, we will no longer be using VS for any further purchases."
"I had tickets for Jerry Seinfeld in Las Vegas. The show was canceled and their policy indicated I would get my refund back to how it was charged. Now they want to hold funds in an account for future use. This is totally wrong. Concerts will not be occurring and I don't typically attend concerts. I need and want my money back! This company should not be used, they are terrible."
"I purchased tickets for an event that was cancelled due to the coronavirus. They told me that I would get a refund as soon as the event was cancelled. Well then they said you can take 120% of the money or a refund. I told them I wanted a refund, then they emailed again and said you can have 110% but if you don't email us you will automatically get the 110%. I already turned down 120% why would I then want 110%. The only reason it is 1 star is because 0 is not possible."
"I purchased Broadway tickets and our show was cancelled due to COVID. I was told on 3/12 by Vivid Seats I would be issued a full refund within 2-4 weeks. I received an email on 3/12 with my account info, confirming again no action needed if receiving a full refund back to original form of payment. On 4/10, still no refund (4+ weeks), contact VS, advised refund still being processed, apologized for the delay but could not give me a new time to expect refund. Contacted again on 4/30, advised their policy changed on 4/15 and an email was sent to all customer communicating the policy change. New policy is VS will issue VS credit to be used within 18 months if you do not contact within 7 days of receipt of email. Note, this is now 5 weeks later after my event. At the time of the event and the purchase date, their policy was in the event of a cancellation a full refund would be provided. Now, 5 weeks later, they change their policy and retro it back? "
"Vivid Seats is a ""RIP-OFF"". Buy concert tickets from ANYONE OTHER than Vivid Seats. If the event is cancelled by the artist, they DO NOT want to give a refund. Instead they ask that you donate your ticket purchase price to the music foundation. (Yes, let them get the tax credit, right? - SURE JACK) or you can save the ticket purchase price for another event and they even give you an additional 10%- oh WOW--so generous ---- NOT. NEVER purchase from Vivid Seats as you will CERTAINLY regret it."
"I've been pursuing my refund for a Yes concert that was cancelled. It's been 6 weeks already and nothing in my bank account. They told me they sent me an email to get my refund, but they didn't explain how the process was to get it. It was confusing information. Not again with this company. I want my money back!!"
"Purchased tickets on 11-2020 for concert in March 2020 and then covid19 came so they rescheduled for May 2020. Now they have rescheduled for September 2020 and we are unable to go due to being in the medical field and school system. I have explained to them I work EMS, I am tired and I can't get off. They have told us to book nothing until this is over and they have taken our earned vacation time and we are accruing none. This is something that is out of our control and all I want is my money back. 340.00 is a lot of money right now to me and they can't make an exception for this. They want a letter from my HR ( who is not working in the office at this time) stating we can't schedule time copy of the tickets and copy of my cc statement where I paid for them... Really I didn't have to give them blood when I bought them :( I'm just really put out. I have never had an experience like this in my life."
"Their original offer (March 11th) was 120% in rewards and I had to respond if I chose that option. The second option was a full refund in 2-4 weeks with no response needed. Then they snuck another email in when I should of had my return back and stated I needed to call. After several phone calls and a live chat I was unable to get ahold of someone. I finally got through today and he said he would only give 110% credit and I will not be getting my money back. I paid $1,859.63 for 4 tickets!!!!"
"I purchased tickets to a concert that was CANCELLED, show was set for 3/20. I have requested a refund 8-10 times thus far and been given the runaround every single time. I know we are in a pandemic but it can’t be that hard to refund people. I just hit the 6 week mark of back and forth emails. At this point, I’m not holding my breath. Buyer, be very beware!"
"Event was canceled due to COVID 19, I received an email that said if I do nothing I would be refunded in 2-4 weeks.... 6 weeks later no refund!!!! They didn't mind taking my money, don't wanna give it!"
The event was cancelled due to Covid-19 and I was sent an email stating I would get a refund. NO refund given. Just a credit on account with them and they refuse to give me refund. Spoke to customer service and said they can’t change it. A credit will remain on file with them.
I purchased tickets for 2020 SlimeFest. Event has been cancelled since April 3rd. They are not refunding me my money. According to their policy I’m supposed to be refunded due to cancellation of event.
"I recently wrote a review about Vivid Seats not refunding my money for the Mets vs Marlins April 28th in San Juan Puerto Rico. After several months of emails, I finally received my full cash refund. I just want to let people know. Be persistent and don't give up."
"I had preseason baseball tickets. Vivid Seats sent me an email saying my money would be refunded when the season was cancelled. One month later, no money, but an email from them telling me I now have money in my ""Vivid Seat"" account +10%. I want my money back. Can't reach a person to talk to, their website is useless. Will never use them again."
We purchased 6 tickets to see Luke Bryan in March. When it was cancelled they sent an email on March 11 saying it would be refunded and “no further action is needed on my part”. Fast forward to April 22 when I called to check on my refund at 4:40 and they said I had missed the 7 day window where they had notified me they had changed their refund policy and would not be able to refund me. I told them I get emails from them all the time and didn’t read through it all the way and assumed the change was going forward not to a purchase made 3 months ago where “no further action is needed on my part”. We asked to speak to someone higher and she said there was nobody higher. I missed the 7 day window by 30 minutes and she could not refund it because the system for refunds was already locked. Right. Never again.
"Similar review to many others posted recently. Purchased tickets to final four in Atlanta, event was cancelled, received email saying I would be refunded in 2-4 weeks and no action was required on my part. 6 weeks later I still had no refund and was informed I was getting a credit to my account instead. Only time I've used Vivid Seats and won't happen again. Buyer beware with these guys. My guess is they made a pretty profit through all the cancellations associated with COVID-19."
"They finally did refund full price for canceled concert ticket, but did not make the process easy. I had to spend over a hour on the phone and repeatedly refuse a future credit in favor of a refund. A full refund should be the default in case of cancelation by the performance."
"We got tickets to Spring Training through Vivid Seats last year for this year. Our event got cancelled and I have emailed Vivid Seats 4-7 times about getting a refund and they say it is coming.  Then they sent me an email saying they would give me 120 percent credit if I wanted it instead of refund. I don't want a credit, I want my money I paid last year for a Spring Training game that got cancelled. I get that the coronavirus is affecting everyone but the company should be on this to give people their money back. It has literally been 5 weeks now and they still say it's coming. I will believe it when I see it. Ridiculous especially since my claim for a refund has been submitted 2 times now."
"*PRICING: I bought 4 tickets to Disney On Ice pre-sale, which was 4X what it would have cost me to buy from Ticketmaster after it went on sale. Much better prices other places."
"Vivid refuses to refund money for MLB tickets when a game is not played. They will only refund if a game is cancelled, not postponed, which is what the MLB is saying. Even under special circumstances, money will not be refunded. I will never use Vivid again. Buyer beware. That's $150 thrown away."
People are having trying times due to covid-19 and this company should be giving people refunds. Nobody is worried about a later date. Refund us our money now!!! I never will purchase tickets from Vivid Seats again...
"I too along with many others have been bitten by the same virus (no pun intended) #VIVIDSEATREFUNDVIRUS. After COUNTLESS calls (good luck there) and COUNTLESS emails, it is always the same excuses. I purchased tickets to the Big Ten Tournament on good faith and Vivid seats had ZERO ISSUES taking my monies over the phone within seconds. Never mind all the commission/fees we paid as well. Good thing I decided to keep my tickets because I was TOLD that if I sent my tickets back, I would receive a refund within 2-4 weeks (right, please stop laughing). I guess we all remember them offering us a credit which I thought was 120% of value at the time, I could be incorrect here. I just wanted my money back, I mean you would think I was asking to much??? They took my monies without any issues. "
"I BOUGHT TICKETS TO CHRIS STAPLETON $630.40. CONCERT WAS POSTPONED, 3 DAYS LATER CANCELED. Vivid sent me an email on 3/19/20 saying I'd get a full refund. It's been 4 weeks still haven't received my refund. They take your money in seconds and keep it to draw the interest. Concert was canceled due to Covid-19, Vivid Seats don't care about you. Send messages to the media. Music artist, and Vivid about their sorry excuse for customer support."
"I purchased very expensive tickets to Pearl Jam- with Covid -19 the tour had been postponed. Date TBD, based on the pandemic who know when... From what I have read from previous reviews it’ll be futile and infuriating to contact them. I reached out to my credit card company with the facts. Glad I did, the reviews for this company are awful. I did make one call to them after the postponement asking about refund- they were RUDE. I hope they go under during this crisis or right after....consumers remember those who do right by the customer."
"I used Vivid to purchase tickets. AFTER I entered my payment information and hit the purchase button I got a receipt that had an unforeseen $135 fee. I called Vivid and the guy said that on one of the pages that you go through to make the purchase says there is a service fee. I started a new purchase process to see this fee warning. Its presence is an absolute joke. There is no question in my mind that it is intentionally obscured. I have never used, and will never use their service again. Ticketmaster charges a fee also, of course, but they let you know what it is in clear language."
"I requested the following based on the NBA suspending its season. ""I want a refund per your policy - ""If an event is canceled with no rescheduled date, you will receive a full refund of the purchase price - including delivery charges"" There is no rescheduled date, nor will they be and everyone knows it - the NBA is working with the owners and players assoc to decide when the 2020/2021 season is to begin, "
This company has been giving me the run around about my refund for an event in early March 2020. I 100% chose the company because of the “guarantee” which is a scam. I just received an email stating now I cannot get a cash refund and will receive credit. Very misleading and dishonest... Do not use them. I will tell all my contacts to run from this company.
I had three tickets to NCAA wrestling championships and the event was cancelled. Vivid Seats has a 100 percent guarantee for refunds in the case the event is cancelled. They offered a 120% credit if you did not want a refund. I chose the refund which according to their website would take 2 to 4 weeks. I have waited 5 weeks and still no refund. I have tried to get through on the phone with the company but no luck. They only communicate via chat and provide no information as to when my refund will arrive. How can they give me credit to purchase new tickets for another event if they cannot refund me the cost of my original tickets. 
"The 100% buyers guarantee that is stated on the website is BOGUS!!! They will NOT refund you, and will give you the run around when asking about the refund. When you call, the customer service line will have you wait over an hour and a half just to have the person say they can not help you. They do not take credit for their own companies, and will blame vendors and others for their issues. The customer service team is RUDE beyond words, and will not assist you for anything. The online chat is a robot that has no idea what you are typing, it will just tell you to wait and eventually you will receive and email about a refund that will not come. The company takes no responsibility or tries to help customers when things are VIVID SEATS fault. Very unprofessional company and I will not be buying from them ever again and advise you not to either."
"My husband purchased three tickets to the Tampa Bay Rays vs Pittsburg Pirates opening day worth a total of $462.39. Due to the unforeseen pandemic, the game has been postponed (obviously). We have called Vivid Seats twice to ask for a refund & both times have been told they cannot authorize a refund because the event is postponed, not canceled. Vivid Seats can only issue a refund if the MLB were to claim the event has been canceled."
This company continues to mislead and not issue refunds for multiple events that were cancelled in EARLY March. There have been dozens of emails and same old song and dance. Buyer beware they SUCK. It does not take 30 plus days to issue a refund for events that will never happen. Blame Covid or not I think this company has more issues than assistance to its once loyal customers.
I have 30+ plus emails stating my refund and this company will not issue me my refund. I call and email weekly and customer service is very rude and short and always lying to me about my refund. This has been going on since 03/12/2020!
I have 20+ emails stating that this company will refund my money since 03/12/2020 and they refuse to issue my refund and continue to tell me lies daily on the status of my refund. It don't take a month to issue a refund.
"I purchased two tickets to the Houston Rodeo, the event was cancelled, not postponed or delayed, it was CANCELLED. I have emailed several times for over a month to get a full refund per their terms and conditions and they refuse to refund my money. I used the site because it was supposed to be safe, it is not. I have filed a claim with my credit card company and it is pending an investigation. I need my money back more than ever. I will never use this ticket service again."
"On 1/21/20 I purchased two hockey tickets for a game in Columbus, Ohio for March 19, 2020. The game was CANCELLED due to the Covid-19 scare. I made an attempt to get a refund as I was told I could but was informed by their computer system that the game was postponed which I know is not true. I have read all the recent reviews and they are all the same which suggests a runaround. This business of sidestepping their agreements is certainly giving me pause for ever pursuing any purchases with Vivid Seats in the future. Lying to me and then stealing from me is unforgivable."
The spring training game was canceled due to rain. Been 5 weeks now and will not return the funds. This all happend before the Corona virus and now since they have lost all sales and income they will not refund my purchase. Now I have to file a claim with the credit card company and go that route. What a sham!!!! I suggest everyone file a claim with the credit card companies now to get in the queue for a refund.
During this hard time with the coronavirus going on our game we were suppose to attend got postponed and maybe canceled. I simply asked for my full refund to be able to use that money to help pay bills etc. Instead of understanding the situation and refunding my money they chose to tell me no. I will never use this site again nor will I ever recommend them to anyone.
"The claim 100% customer satisfaction which is not true in my case. We purchased concert ticket through Vivid Seats for my daughter 30th birthday. Due to Covid-19, the concert was rescheduled for one year later. We do not want to go in one year or if we will be able to go, so I requested a refund. They charge fees and said I could resell them somewhere else to recover my money. This is totally unacceptable."
Purchased tickets months ago for a May 2020 concert. Due to virus the concert was rescheduled in August. It’s the same day I am attending another concert. Vivid Seats refuses to refund my money. I have contacted them but they refuse to assist me.
Vivid Seats resells tickets at a very high price. Then when your event is canceled and you cant attend the rescheduled event you are out your money. Try Stub Hub. You'll be happier. Vivid Seats is awful.
"We purchased tickets to CMA Fest for 2020 and it has been CANCELED due to the Coronavirus. This is completely unexpected and out of our control. Vivid Seats sent an e-mail stating the event is rescheduled for June 2021, though CMA Fest itself announced CMA Fest 2020 WILL NOT HAPPEN. CMA Fest is an annual event. Rescheduling it means it would happen again in the same year. This is not a reschedule or postponement as Vivid Seats is trying to claim. Vivid Seats will not issue us a refund in the amount of $1775.81. "
"If you watch the behavior of some businesses during this crisis you can get a picture of who they really are and despite their empty words of working with their customers, they have a strategy of milking every dollar they can. Last November my wife and I purchased two tickets for a Michael Buble concert to be held May 8, 2020 in Las Vegas. We got the tickets through Vivid Seats and the total cost for two tickets was $742. Forget the fact that the only way you can get these tickets is through a third-party vendor such as Vivid Seats, accompanied by their markup. It became very obvious that the concert was not going to be held on the proscribed date. We were informed today that in fact the concert had been “postponed” to a later date to be announced."
"Bought tickets to a Dance Gavin dance event scheduled for march 18th. It was cancelled the week before. Got an email from customer service saying they would provide refunds. When I contacted them and requested a refund, they said I couldn't get one but I could resell my tickets. I tried reselling my tickets but my event isn't even posted on the app so I'm out $120. The customer service is garbage and won't help you. I'm never using this service again. During a time like this, I need the money back for bills. The fact that this company doesn't care about its customers, says a lot."
"As everyone knows the MLB season is on hold and very well might not play at all. I purchased 2 tickets to Dodgers vs Giants March 28th 2020. The game is canceled. Vivid Seats does not want to refund the money. They tried to tell me the game will be played later, which is not exactly true. I would suggest that anyone doing business with Vivid Seats be prepared to have your money taken and not get it back. Very poor company that lies to customers. There is absolutely no reschedule date and MLB has in fact come out and said it wont be for several more months until they know if and what games might be played. Vivid Seats is holding my money, which I am not ok with. Buyer beware on this scalper site that keeps your money, even when it's the venue that cancels."
"We had tickets to Shania Twain in Las Vegas for March 14, 2020. This was during the Corona Virus outbreak. Our governor had issued a do not travel mandate which we decided to follow, and not attend the concert. Vivid Seats would not give us a refund. Our friends who were going to meet us had used other resellers and received refunds or the ability to use the money spent for an event later in the year. I have used Vivid for all kinds of events, but will no longer have anything to do with them. I received refunds on every other aspect of our trip; hotels, air travel, car rental, etc. Beware of Vivid!"
"I will never use Vivid Seats again. They refuse to refund my money for tickets to see The Eagles at The Forum in Los Angeles, CA. The show was scheduled for 4/18/2020 and due to the Covid 19 pandemic, it has been rescheduled for 9/26/2020. I cannot make the trip for that date. They basically said, sorry. All that I can do is sell my tickets online, which so far has proved to be unsuccessful. Further, no one knows if it will be safe to travel then. Due to the financial burden this pandemic has caused, I really need my money back. Shame on them for holding people's money during this Global crises. I'm furious!! Shame on them and everyone involved including The Eagles! Never again will I ever spend this much money ($400 a piece) on tickets."
"Since my event is postponed due to COVID-19 they will not refund even though I live 900 miles away. Although they tell you that they understand and are committed to your satisfaction, they plead with you to be understanding, they are not. Somehow they do not understand that when you buy tickets to an event like a major league baseball game, you have chosen a date that works for you. I had plane tickets to Seattle and ballgame tickets to the Mariners, I live 900 miles away in Utah. Flying in for Dad's birthday, impossible to predict a global pandemic that has messed up and shut down plans all over. This is not me choosing a bad date by accident, this is not me having something come up where I can't fulfill my obligation, this is a global pandemic and Seattle is a hot spot. "
"I left one star because I could not go any lower. My fiancé and I purchased tickets to see a show in Nashville. She flew in from another country and I drove 9 hours to see the concert. Sadly, the concert was cancelled (March 16th) and rescheduled for October 21st due to COVID-19. On contacting Vivid and explaining the fact that we could not afford to make that trip again and requested a refund. Vivid's customer service (or lack thereof) just kept repeating, ""We cannot help you, but you can try to resell them."" My fiancé sent several emails which came back with the same response. She cannot even relist because the dates nor the concert are even posted yet. We need to be refunded as she is a teacher and her school is closed till further notice and I don't have any guarantees. Vivid, especially during times like this, doesn't stand by their service claims and they are leaving their customers hanging out to dry."
I purchased NBA tickets for $350. Prior to the game it was suspended for the entire season due to the Coronavirus. I contacted Vivid Seats as they have a 100% guarantee on money back. They refuse to refund me and tell me that I will receive tickets to another game although they have cancelled for the season. I would not recommend purchasing anything from this company.
"In this time of world crisis, refusing to refund tickets purchased is criminal. I hope that all the customers that will read this comment, choose to buy in any other website. Worst customer service and sales policy. They invite the client to wait that the event will be (maybe) rescheduled, and as soon as it will be rescheduled (if?,maybe), I will have 24 hours before the nba match to find a ticket reseller and try to sell it. They really write me to search one, because not only they don’t refund anyone, but they won’t resell a ticket sold by his website. “Try to write resell ticket on google”!!,. Thank you, next time I will buy directly in one of these company."
"I purchased tickets for an NBA game that was scheduled for the end of March at Staples Center. Due to the coronavirus, all NBA games have been suspended. Vivid seats will not refund me my money for the tickets. They said the game is ‘postponed’ so I cannot get a refund. But there is no reschedule date so this company is going to hold onto my money indefinitely although their ""so-called"" guarantee says ""If an event is canceled with no rescheduled date, you are naturally entitled to a full refund of the purchase price, including delivery charges."" The game was canceled for the dates I purchased my tickets for. And if I can’t make the rescheduled date, then I am responsible for reselling my tickets. Nice. I have never dealt with a business that was so adamant about not returning your money for a service you didn’t get. Terrible."
"I was going to be travelling from Australia to the U.S in April, and of course, needed to postpone the trip indefinitely. I was going to be seeing Ali Wong in DC but like many other events, this was postponed/cancelled. As it so happened, Vividseats moved all of the ticketing dates to late July/early August with no input from paying customers. Unfortunately I am unable to make the new dates due to an indefinite travel ban and the ONLY option I am given is to resell the tickets as I do not ""qualify"" for a refund."
"I purchased tickets for an NBA game that was scheduled for the end of March at Capital One Arena. Due to no one's fault, all NBA games have been suspended. Vivid seats will not refund me my money for the tickets. I talked to 2 reps at the company, one of which was a ‘senior’ rep and nothing. They said the game is ‘postponed’ so I cannot get a refund. But there is no reschedule Darren so this company is going to hold onto my money indefinitely."
"We have 4 premium tickets to a Red Sox game that has been postponed. They offered to reissue tickets for when it is rescheduled. When you are travelling 3000 miles for a specific date, we should receive a full refund."
DO NOT buy ANY event tickets from Vivid Seats!! The risk will not be worth it. You WILL BE SORRY. Just looking out for other unsuspecting customers that might get scammed just as we did. Vivid will not refund our NBA Pacer tickets that we paid $1000 for this season. We were informed that it isn't their problem that the 2020 season was canceled and we will just have to go to a 2021 game when the new season schedule is released or sell those tickets ourselves when the time comes. WHAT?? This is a scandalous company with ZERO integrity that will lie their way out of whatever it takes to keep your money. Their website says the EXACT OPPOSITE of how they are actually handling things. DO NOT BE FOOLED!
"1 year ago, I purchased 6 - $100 each, tickets for Sebastian Maniscalco tickets at Harrah's Cherokee. The show had been called off and postponed twice during the year. Now I have $600 worth of tickets to a show that doesn’t even have a date. I found out from Harrah's that they could refund my money had I purchased the tickets from Ticketmaster, but for me to ask for a refund from Vivid Seats. A customer service agent Welbin, refused to even consider it and he ended my call. I guess live and learn. I would NEVER purchase anything from Vivid Seats again. They are not reputable as I came to find out the hard way. If you choose to use them, get ready to get the shaft if your show doesn’t go on. I doubt this show will ever happen, but VIVID SEATS doesn’t give a crap. They have your money and your tickets are worthless."
"I was an idiot, I bough my concert tickets without shopping around from the first website that popped up. I paid 40% high price than I should have to get my concert tickets if I bought them from Ticketmaster. Don't be an idiot like me, shop around."
"This is extremely disappointing, with the Covid-19 Pandemic Chicago is not exactly a great destination right now. Communities and health organizations are taking measures to stop the spread and nationally it is stated to stay away from large gatherings. NBA even addressed this. I had tickets to see “Gabriel Iglesias” Tickets for this Saturday and with the spread it makes the travel a really bad option. I called the center and they said to call the third party and they would give a refund or exchange. I contacted Vivid Seats and they only cared about their money. Since it is not cancelled they won’t do anything or make any arrangements. Pandemic what pandemic???? I WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY IN THE FUTURE!!!!"
I bought tickets for an event. I also bought the insurance as my husband is disabled. Something told me to call them and they cancelled my order because they had my email address wrong. When I confirmed the tickets I told him my email. They also had my cell phone to text me the problem. He put the order in again. Well 2 hrs later no confirmation so I called back and there still was no order in there. Almost 3 hrs now. Also the order is not showing up on my VIVID account. Really angry at this. We can't get anyone on the phone for the insurance either due to the virus. Also you can't get no one on the phone at VIVID. I called like 4 different numbers and you can't get a person. STAY AWAY from these people.
"I purchased two tickets to March 7, 2020 Boston Bruins v Tampa Bay Lightning hockey game. I paid $330 for two tickets and I got an email from the seller to accept the tickets which I did. When I signed into the td garden app which is where the tickets are suppose to be at... There are NO tickets. I contact Vivid Seats customer service explain everything and provide pictures that I never received tickets and was told they will investigate. The investigation was the seller provided proof he sent tickets and even though I provided proof I never received them I will not be getting any refund. Vivid seats is a scam."
Price is usually gouged. Same seats will be cheaper most other sites. Etickets are convenient. I'm not sure what else to write but it asked 250 dollars for lawn seats for a 40 dollar concert once. Customer service was pretty awesome.
"I purchased 4 tickets Feb 9, almost 30 days prior to the event. ORDER TOTAL $330.96*. I received a call today, 1 day before that the tickets are not available. This evening has been planned for weeks with out of town family that has come in for this damn show at The Funny Bone. What a disappointment. And no I have ZERO interest in your $100 gift card. This isn't about money. Isn't about plans that have been ruined. WHY WOULD I EVEN CONSIDER THIS AS A POSSIBILITY AGAIN."
"All they care about is that the seller emailed the tickets. They don't care whether the buyer actually received the tickets or if they did if they could open the email and access the tickets. They use Ticketmaster for their delivery platform but they take no responsibility to make sure that the buyer actually got the tickets. The Denver Nuggets box office (where I spent most of the first quarter of the game) assured me that I never received the tickets. Shame on you Vivid. This proves that your ""guarantee"" is worthless. Total lack of integrity. Ed"
"I feel Vivid has a much better selection of tickets advance than Ticketmaster and some of the other outlets. I always compare Ticketmaster and Vivid. Vivid wind out every time. If you’re looking for a better section of tickets, try Vivid. Not only that they usually have better seat selections as well. Go ahead, check it out."
"Bought tickets for a concert out of town, opted for the insurance (as this was my 1st time using Vivid). Purchase went through for the tickets and later that day I received an email telling me that the insurance was not available for this event. Called to try to cancel tickets and was told no by customer service. Drive to the city of the concert, bought a hotel room for the weekend, kids were very excited. Receive an email the morning of the concert that it was ""postponed"" until October!"
"When I had questions, I was able to call and get straight answers without the run around. Got what I needed at not so expensive price. When I needed to get directions on directions the same lady was able to help me find the directions. Also who I could talk to at the event."
I purchased two concert tickets from VividSeats to a total of $114.09 only to find out the tickets were standing room only which was not designated on the event advertising or ticket. I just happen to call the venue for the correct starting time and asked about the seating. Of course they would not give me a refund so I appealed to PayPal. What a RIP OFF company. They knew it was standing room alone and did not say it because it would lessen ticket sales!
$80 delivery fee for emailing me the tickets...really? And the markup on all tickets is just downright robbery. I go to a few sporting events a year in New York with my son and the excess fees added on top of the inflated ticket prices are crazy. 3 tickets at $250 each for a ranger game in upper deck is costing me almost $1000. Oh. And inflated parking passes. I went to a jet game. It was going to cost me $125 for parking pass..
"No tickets for Lauren Daigle concert. I purchased 3 tickets on Dec. 12 from Vivid as a Xmas present for my daughters. They don't send them early (red flag) and so I got a message from them on Wednesday Jan. 25, 2020 that they were ready and had been delivered via email but no links to download!!! None of my emails from them had a link or any semblance my tickets were sitting there ready to download. Mind you I didn't look at my email which if you are waiting for your tickets please check your email BEFORE going to your event."
"I purchased tickets for a Broadway show from Vivid based on the theater recommendation and their 100% guarantee. An error was made by Vivid and I was sent the wrong tickets docs after Vivid confirmed the correct ones via email. This was my wife's 40th birthday present. We spent $1000 flying in from out of state... just for this show. We were turned away at the door. Spent 30 minutes on hold during my call to vivid customer service. Their response after all of that was to just refund the ticket purchases. I asked if we could be taken care of better since the error on Vivid's part cost far more to us than just the ticket purchase. After being put on hold again, we were offered a $37 voucher for the next purchase on Vivid. The total compensation from Vivid for such a costly error to us was a $37 voucher... Mistakes happen unfortunately, but the compensation for that mistake was insulting and careless."
"I do think their fees are a little pricey. On the flip side, once you have purchased tickets they will send you a discount off your next order. This is a bonus if there’s something you want to see soon after."
"Fees are a joke. Why charge extra for purchasers doing all the work & saving time? And the fees charged are outrageous, too. Stupid. I have chosen to not buy tickets & stay home more often than ever before because of idiotic fees."
"My daughter loves 21 Pilots so I bought 4 tickets for her and friends, paid a whopping $500. I never once talked to real person only automated operator that kept asking me the same questions over and over again. I emailed them endlessly; they promised me I’d get the tickets 48 hours prior to the event (a month and a half before the show). When 2 of her friends bailed out I was left with 2 tickets. I tried reselling them on Vivid Seats, they said no because I wasn’t an authorized seller. I said why not, they said, ""Because you don’t have the tickets,"" I was like, ""DUH!!!! You haven’t given them to me even though you took my money,"" Long story short, I wasn’t able to resell the other 2 so got stuck with them. Will never do that again. Do your research that I didn’t do, don’t get into a hurry, read reviews, check prices at different sites, best suggestion I have is buy at Ticket Master as soon as they go on sale to avoid 3rd party profit and legal scalpers profits!!!!"
"These guys are trash! When I click right through the Clippers website it goes to AXS/Vivid seats. I ordered 2 tickets and then 5 minutes later, I get an email that they're cancelled. I call to find out what's wrong and I'm told my address was incorrect on my credit card. I know my own address! It wasn't wrong. He says I can order them again and this time it won't be an issue. I log back on and suddenly the tickets are $40 more each. Whatever. I just want the tickets. I order again and and get the same cancel email! Now I have $800 in charges on my card that I have to wait 3-5 days to refund and no tickets. DO NOT BUY FROM HERE"
I paid a good price for a good seat and when they sent me my ticket via email it was a crappy seat for a way too much when I could have gone through TicketMaster for better. They need to correct their mistake and give me the right ticket or a refund. Grrr Ticket Master is the way.
"Display seats available so you would be able to see where your seat is in relation to the stage, a full seating view like Ticket Master would make this a better site. They do offer discounts if you dont buy at first which is great but you still dont know exactly where you will be sitting."
We had a great experience the three times that we have purchased tickets from Vivid Seats. They were very pleasant when we talked to them on the phone about getting seats to the shows last minute. Never an issue with anything.
"The ease of use makes the Vivid Seats app a pleasure to use. I like that you can search any artist, and it lets you know if, where, and when the desired artist will be playing near you. The cost of doing business with ticket brokers, is just out of control. When placing an order, there should just be one cost, no matter how many seats that you are purchasing. Especially when using the print at home feature. This isn't unique to Vivid, though. I would say that is the only negative, when using any of these sites."
The anxiety of waiting until the day of an event is not worth the slight reduction in fees. Customer service will DO NOTHING about missing tickets until the day before an event. If you must travel to an event you are out of luck. You CANNOT even get hold of customer service! There is no excuse why a reseller can not provide tickets in a timely manner. WILL NOT USE AGAIN.
"Deceitful practices! I had been shopping for concert tickets and shortly after comparing prices with other sites I received a pop up notification in regards to an additional 10% Off. This pop up notification pushed me back to the mobile app site and clearly stated additional 10% discount taken off at check out. Going through the prompts and checkout, the 10% discount was never applied. Without delay I called customer service immediately following the transaction and was told to send a screenshot of the pop up notification. I explained that it wasn't possible because the pop up notification simply pushed me back to the mobile site and wasn't available for me to take a screenshot. Long and short, I was told tough luck. This is a horrible practice and experience. It's been 15 minutes since making this transaction."
Did not realize my etickets couldn't be transferred on Vivid Seats until after they sold. I was charged $116 for the tickets that I had but couldn't provide because they said they didn't allow etickets. Now I'm out $116 more for my tickets.
"Was not able to get tickets to download. Call Vivid seats, said they would send an email with an attachment, never got the email until after the game started, bought tickets outside the arena. Received the email after the game started. Called vivid seats the next day to tell the about the problem, they said they sent an email and I told them I didn’t receive it until after the game had started. They said they were sorry but they couldn’t refund the money. I told them again I didn’t receive the email until after the game had started, they said they were sorry."
I would give this company 0 stars if it would allow it. This was my first time using viviseats.com to purchase Monster Jam tickets for 2 adults and 2 children. I have never been to this show nor do I know much about it except it is a car show. We went into the event and the noise was unbearable for my children. So we had to leave 20 minutes after the start of the event. We went to the ticket booth and asked for a refund and the ticket booth basically told us they would be happy to refund if the tickets were bought from us (we had bought tickets from scalpers which is how the ticket booth manager referred to Vividseats.com). I called viviseats.com. Explained my situation and asked for 50% refund - and they put me on hold for an hour and then hung up without a proper close of the call. I will never use vividseats.com again. If the ticket booth is willing to refund my tickets - it makes better sense to buy from Ticketmaster.
"Purchased from Vivid Seats and spent over 12 HOURS on the phone with customer service. Customer service doesn't read their notes from previous conversations and trouble shooting making each call even more frustrating. They ask the same questions and place you on hold every few minutes which ends up being hours of time. Per Ticketmaster, I was sold tickets that were NON-TRANSFERABLE although vivid disagrees. Either way hours of my time wasted, no tickets, 10 unhappy people that won't see All for the Hall on Feb. 10th. I'll never use VIVID again."
"I booked 3 days in NYC to surprise my wife to see Andrea Bocelli - airfare and hotel. The event was postponed without a new date and Vivid Seats will not refund the tickets nor allow me to speak to any management. The entire reason we are going to NYC is to see him and it will likely be impossible to take off several days again when I run a business and have 3 kids who need babysitting. Whether or not vivid is third party and allowing ticket sellers to use their platform they should be fully responsible for refunding the money if this happens. Now, I am out $900, but stuck going to NYC with no show to see, waiting for the “new date” which we’ll unlikely be able to come back and see. The phone clerk said “you can try selling the tickets on social media”, are you kidding? Absolutely terrible customer service and refund policy. I will never use this company again."
I purchased tickets via Vivid Seats and selected the e-ticket option. The site stated I would not receive the tickets until the day before the event which is ridiculous and puts you in an uncomfortable position to have to wait till last minute and if anything goes wrong you need to adjust your schedule and make sure you get your tickets properly to be able to go to this event of which you probably spent a lot of money on. Vivid Seats exists as a service to provide ease of ticket purchase and delivery. Ironically they are not easy to use and have horrible customer service. Their customer service number gives minimal option for any ticket delivery issues and diverts you to an online chat where they take 5-10 minutes to respond each time and often ask the same questions over and over.
"You might be finding yourself in a similar situation as I. Wondering if you should give this company a shot to save yourself 10 bucks, don't bother. While I assume that most of the listings are legitimate the system they have in place to protect the customer is not strong enough, I purchased tickets 47 days in advanced of the concert and here I find myself 6hrs from the start of concert with no ticket. They keep telling me that I need to allow until 3hrs before the start of the concert for them to do anything. I find it very unreasonable to have a policy like this in place. Am I just supposed to drive to the venue and assume that VividSeats will be able to provide me with my ticket? "
"I called to book tickets for Toronto in Tampa NHL game for Feb 25, 2020. When I received the e:mail the tickets sent were for March 25, 2020. I called in about 5 minutes after I noticed wrong date on tickets. Vivid finally called me back. Said they could not help me but offered at $60.00 credit for next purchase. I said no thanks. I have a flight booked for Feb 23, 2020 into Tampa and I guess I will miss the game. NEVER AGAIN VIVID."
"I purchased lawn seat tickets for a Jimmy Buffett Concert from Vivid Seats thinking they were a decent people price at $105 each. The sales person said she would discount them too! I think it was $4 off. I just checked the same tickets on Ticketmaster and they are $37.50 a piece. My fault for being stupid and buying from a reputable company. Of course No Refunds, No cancellations. They’re smiling all the way to the bank. From now on Ticketmaster only!"
"I ordered tickets from Vivid for the Texas A&M basketball game on Feb. 4. They did not arrive. After multiple emails over 2 days...nothing. They say they are not responsible, they are just a middle man broker. BUYER BEWARE. I am out $53 and NO ONE CARES. The buck is being passed and now they are attempting to have whoever owned the tickets to resend to me at an alternate email address. This is completely unacceptable, it should not be this hard and painful a process. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. The word ""fraud"" comes to mind."
"I placed an order for tickets. Paid $335 per seat for Jason Aldean in Knoxville. I received an email to print the tickets I purchased. I printed them. Tickets had wrong name, wrong seats and were half the price. I called and they explained they were not longer available and I had upgraded seats. They are RIGHT ON TOP OF THE STAGE. Not what I wanted. I was advised that I could get NO refund and could not speak to anyone else. HORRIBLE...DO NOT USE VIVID SEATS. She said I could sell them. No one would pay for those seats!"
Purchased Bon Jovi tickets for a very large amount of money. Paid in full and Vivid has not delivered the tickets. They say they are waiting for the seller to send them. I found the exact tickets (sec. row and seats) for sale on another ticket website. I asked for a refund due to be scamming. Their response was all sales are final and there is no refund. There was no sale!!!! I paid and never received the tickets. That's not a sale. That's Consumer Fraud. Terrible customer service that runs you around in circles again and again. Stay far away.
"All I can say is DON'T SELL on Vivid Seats. I bought 2 Mötley Crüe tickets for Hershey in Aug. I was stupid and should have waited until they were actually released before I used Vivid Seats. I ended up getting 2 more tickets off another website that were better and cheaper.... Well that’s a plus. I sold the 2 tickets that I bought on Vivid for almost what I paid. Now I find out that they won’t pay me until 100 days before the August show. That’s crazy, and disappointing. They are keeping my money, and making interest off it. It’s my fault for not reading the fine print, so I would not recommend Vivid Seats for anything to anyone. Let my lesson be your lesson-don’t sell on it. The customer service was horrible, she basically called me stupid!!!! Maybe I am, I should have read it more closely. I never had any issues with any rival website."
Purchased my tickets for the Skill Session of the NHL All Star game in early December for the January 2020 game. Received numerous emails from them regarding upcoming events. Tickets did not arrive when purchased. Follow up with Customer Service with 10 days till event. Spent almost 2 hours on the chat line trying to correct issue. Then told they might not be able to resolve until I changed my email carrier. Opened a new account and 4 days before event electronic tickets were sent and received. (Thank you Michael from Customer Service). I did not feel confident until actually inside the event. I will never purchase from Vivid Seats in the future and it's back to TicketMaster or StubHub for me.
"I purchased NBA tickets and parking passes for my husband for his birthday. On the day of the game, our parking passes were not accepted. There was no phone number to reach out to Vivid about this issue. I tried to live chat with them, but the live chat was not working. When I got home I tried to live chat again, this time we were cut off half way through explaining my issue. I sent an email, and never heard back from them. They sent me an email for a review and I left a 1 star review. "
"Vivid Seats is the worst ticket provider due to their horrible customer service practices, terrible process to retrieve tickets (which will involved days-weeks of your time after the purchase), and broken systems that will require you to provide multiple email addresses if you ever want your highly marked up tickets. I purchased tickets to Oprah Winfrey on September 6, 2019 and did not receive my actual tickets until 6:00 pm on January 17, 2020 for the event to occur on Jan 19, 2020 at 9:00 am. I was on the phone, email, chat with Vivid Seats 20 times to make this happen and had to submit a second email (wait a few hours) and then call again to actually get the tickets. The whole ordeal was the worst most frustrating experience ever!!! I normally write reviews for excellent service, products etc but am very sad to feel compelled to warn others of this terrible company and experience!!"
"I purchased NBA tickets from this site, and never received them. I got an order confirmation but no tickets. Their customer service never e-mailed me back and their automated service messenger is absolutely zero help. They have no phone number listed and no way to get your money back. Their “guarantee” is meaningless. Do not give these people your money...they will scam and disappoint you."
"I ordered seats for the Blake Shelton concert in Omaha, NE. I was checking the seating as saw my tickets say Section B Row 19. There is no Section B Row 19. Trying to find out where I sit. There is no talking with anyone as automated and keeps going in a circle but no option to talk with anyone. Live chat, been waiting for 20 minutes now for response. Read their 100% guarantee.... Well I'm lucky my brother-in-law is an attorney!! Will follow up with additional review if / when I get this resolved! Michael"
"First time purchasing tickets on their site and they contact me to let me know the order wasn’t processed after they had already charged me. Being that the seats were going fast, they offer to change me to another area that is FURTHER and I agree. They say the area I’m being located to is MORE expensive but they’re going to waive the fee. They had also charged me a UPS delivery fee in the first transaction and in the change, say they’re going to be e-tickets visible on cellphones. I will never buy anything else through Vivid Seats because of this awful experience. I feel scammed."
"Vivid Seats sent multiple confirmations to us in email fo rmonths before the event. They happily took the $1000 from our account at the time of purchase. Then three days before the show, Vivid seats texted us to say, ""We were unable to procure seats to your event"". Rang customer service who said there is no guarantee they can get you tickets, despite the fact we had three updated emails confirming the order. Still waiting for my refund"
Vivid Seats charges exorbitant fees for providing a service of minimal value. I'm talking about a $40 premium PER TICKET for $120 seats. Just outrageous. I will participate in every class action lawsuit against companies like this (ahem TicketMaster) until they do not exist in this world. Three are better options out there for secondary market tickets. Vivid Seat's customer service is hot helpful either. You would think that they could provide some valuable service to their customers. One can only hope that that this company WILL not exist in the future. A company that sticks it to their customers should and will go out of business eventually. Good luck to anyone utilizing Vivid Seats. Get your wallets ready.
So Saturday morning we received our tickets to the game at 1:35 pm on Saturday from Ticketmaster. I am beginning to think this issue was caused by Ticketmaster who told Vivid Seats the tickets had been sent to my e-mail when in fact they had not sent them. Even though we made the game I spent two days stressed out over this and we had to rush to make the game in time since many of us had made other plans for the game. We are all glad we made it to the game but this definitely made this an experience I would not like to repeat particularly for what I paid.
"This is by far the worst ticketing site available. The customer service department is more concerned about the ticket sellers than the customers buying the tickets. Customer service department was very rude, and when ask to talk to manager they said the manager wasn’t working. They worked hard to end your call without resolving the issues. Ordered tickets in September and didn’t receive tickets until December after I filed a formal complaint with my credit card company. If I didn’t do this, I probably would have never received the tickets. Go purchase tickets from other ticket outlets and stay away from Vividseats!"
"I would give a ZERO rating if I could. I was totally excited about purchasing tickets to Hamilton in San Francisco for my husband. I purchased them way back in September of 2019. I spoke to a sales rep and he talked me into purchasing 2 tickets in the loge section for a little bit higher of a price. My husband has been wanting to see this play for a very long time, so I couldn't wait to tell him! The day before the show, after we had made reservations at a hotel, I received an urgent message for me to contact the company. Upon contacting them, I was told that the ""seller dropped the ball"" and no longer had the loge seat available and that I was being reseated in the orchestra section Row E Seats 11 and 13. Needless to say I was incredibly upset."
"Would give 0 stars if I could. Vivid Seats is a reseller. They charge for shipping tickets ($8 standard delivery charge), don't ship them, then change to email delivery with no offer to refund shipping until pushed. When calling, press ""8"" in phone menu for live person. Also, email will say print tickets then will send ANOTHER email saying only smartphone scan is accepted. What if person doesn't have a smartphone??? Not everyone does...that info is not on the website. They need to know the venue requirements before reselling tickets."
"I purchased 3 tickets for Hamilton for only $133.00 ea., however I ended up paying $119.00 in fees alone. When I contacted customer service asking them to explain why I could not locate an itemized receipt to explain how fees were calculated, she had no explanation. I asked were the fees a flat rate or a percentage, her answer was yes (huh?). I asked to speak to a supervisor, still no resolution. It's funny, the same tickets/seats were originally priced at $178 ea. and over a two day period of me checking throughout daily, the price goes down to $133 ea., but if you add the outrageous fee(s) to the final purchased ticket price, it almost equals the original price listed. I guess they were going to get their money one way or another. All jokes aside, there is no transparency in their pricing and therefore no accountability. Not cool."
"Never got my tickets. Sent them to another city. WTF. Sales rep just did what he had to sell me a ticket and lied about the timing of it. This place is a joke, avoid and go with someone more established."
"Ordered tickets for a game the day before, I understand it could have taken 12 hours or so to get them, nope try 28 hours and didn't leave me with enough time to actually make it to the game with the tickets being the venue was 2 hours away. I got the tickets 30 MINS before the event started and tried to cancel and get a refund. They said there was nothing that could be done and they have a clause saying you may receive tickets shortly before the event. Just buy direct so you have the tickets in your possession long before an event starts and you can plan accordingly."
"This is second time I have used Vivid. First was last year for a football game and just last week for a concert. Even though tickets were ordered months before event they were delivered in less than 24 hours before event. This has happened twice. It is next to impossible to get a live customer service representative. They advertise they are the only resale agency that has live customer service, but not true. You must chat via text if you want customer service. They kept changing receiving date. "
"I ordered $130 tickets. 3 in total. I paid a far higher price for the entire transaction. This came with the promise that Vivid Seat, would, if unable complete the order I'd get something better. What I got were far lesser $69 tickets (my fee unchanged). They made zero effort to fix the problem, arguing that I got what I paid for. You get what you get with these crooks, and you don't get what you pay for."
"At the last minute I purchased two tickets for Hamilton in San Francisco from Vivid Seats. The tickets were orchestra seats in row F and the order total was $750. When I received the tickets I noticed a large red note stating “OBSTRUCTED VIEW.” When I went back to the order summary, I noticed in small text under “Notes” that the tickets were obstructed view. I never noticed this note during the purchase process. In my opinion, the site should have included a pop up warning or some way of highlighting that the tickets were obstructed view. I called Customer Service at Vivid Seats to ask for a refund and the representative told me there was nothing that she could do. Needless to say I will never use VividSeats again, and I strongly recommend that customers avoid this website until they more clearly highlight tickets with obstructed views."
"I bought tickets on Vivid Seats for the CBS Sports Classic and the tickets never showed up in my flash account. Vivid refused to give refund, instead opting to blame Flash Seats. Don't believe the guarantee!!! I wish I could give zero stars."
"Vivid Seats did not deliver the tickets as paid for. We asked for a reissue hours before the event and Vivid was unable to comply. Because we requested a reissue, Vivid then would not refund the cost of the tickets. It is a case of 'he said, she said', however Vivid benefitted far more by the lie than my family did. If Vivid only does this in a small percentage of its cases, it is a great scam. We missed the rodeo and paid for the tickets. Don't do it, there has to be a better way,"
"They sell the tickets at the prices 3 times higher than in the theater (we have not realized that since the San Francisco Theater Group, the umbrella of this institution, has a misleading name, giving you the impression that it is a representative of actual theaters) and they do not disclose all kinds of outrageously high fees (close to $100) only after you buy the tickets. The tickets are not refundable. They are rude on the phone and the customer support is extremely weak. The license of this fraudulent company should be terminated. They steal money from customers."
"I purchased game tickets and a parking pass for a football game through the website. The tickets came through Ticketmaster and seem okay. The parking pass came through and is not for the correct game - it is for a game months ago. I called immediately and went through many automated steps, no one ever came on. I chatted with someone and she said they needed to contact the seller to fix the mistake. Since we are traveling for the game and it is a parking pass that needs to be printed, I need this resolved several hours before the game but they are telling me it will be resolved before game time. We are now 6 hours in from contacting customer service and there is no resolution. Very, very, very poor situation. We have asked to speak with a manager each time and there is no manager, they will not escalate our situation."
"I received an email concerning an upcoming concert from Vivid Seats. It gave the appearance like they were the ones distributing the tickets. I purchased two tickets at $140/piece. $45 per ticket was tacked on per ticket as additional fees. When I arrived at the event, tickets were $35 a piece. That’s when I realized that I had purchased from a secondary seller, a scalper. I was charged 5 times the amount for a show that was not sold out...along with seats in the second to last row. This company is a scam with predatory practices. Do not do business with them!"
"I had a very bad experience buying ticket from Vivid Seats (Thru Groupon). I bought a hockey ticket (for Dec 10 game) on Nov 22 and paid the fee, their confirmation email said that I would received the email ticket on Dec 9. However till Dec 10 I still didn't receive the ticket, I checked all folders including spam and trash but no ticket email at all. So I contacted Groupon and Vivid Seats to check what is going on. After a few days they said that the email ticket was sent on Dec 7. OK I asked them to forward me that email or provide any proof that the email had been sent, so I can work with the email server see what was going wrong. But they couldn't provide anything just keep saying it was sent on Dec 7. Very disappointed and unhappy experience with this company."
"I bought Broadway from Vivid. I traveled all the way to NYC only to be told that the tickets are a scam. I contacted Vivid and I had to go through a boat load of prompts designed to wear me out. When I reached an agent I was disconnected 3 times. Again, a method by this company to make you go away. Once I got through they told me I was the one who disconnected. And that they would do some sort of investigation, blah blah, trying to tell me I did something wrong. Disgusting company and people. Amazon would just give you a refund on the spot. I will never use this company again. I'll make sure I go out of my way to tell everyone how rude and corrupt they are."
Scam-no notice of their Service Fee: $132.98  Delivery Fee: $5. As if the price of a concert isn't ridiculous enough... Without any notice I was given a $132.98 service fee charge! After dealing with a chat robot... They told me that I agreed to it in the Terms and Agreements that of course goes on forever. NOT DISCLOSING Fees upfront and center is false advertising... Seats that were supposed to be $236 per seat for two ended up costing me $621.98. WOW - that is insane. Avoid their service at all costs!
"Here are just the facts: Ordered tickets totaling $515 for Devils/Lightning March 15 of 2020. They sent tickets for Devils Capitals this Saturday December 14 of 2019. Here is the worst part. I am on vacation and cannot use the tickets. There is no customer service and I was pulling my hair out trying to exchange or get a refund on these tickets. They have only pre-printed faqs and nobody to talk to. I am out $515 period. If you use a service like this with no way to exchange or cancel tickets you are as nuts as I was. And remember, they sent me the wrong tickets and the only response I got from an email was that I confirmed the purchase for that game on that night. I did not but can do nothing. The good reviews are from the people who lucked out. This is a gamble because if a mistake is made you are screwed plain and simple. DC."
"VividSeats canceled my ticket order when they couldn’t confirm the purchase within 24 hours. I repurchased the tickets, a birthday gift for my daughter, at three times the cost only to learn the same day, two hours after the purchase, that the concert was canceled. They would not refund my money because the concert was rescheduled for FIVE months later. I couldn’t go then and it wasn’t a birthday present anymore for her. They said I could resell the tickets but since they cancelled my cheap ones and I was forced to repurchase them at exorbitant cost, I stood no chance of getting my money back. The customer service agent I called was unwilling to either give me his name or transfer me to a supervisor, always a red flag to a consumer. I resolved this through my bank, always worth a try when a business takes an unreasonable position."
"I purchased 2 tickets at $157 each for a Total of $364. However when I was billed I was billed a total of $410. I was not given a detailed accounting of how much the bill was going to be prior to pushing purchase. Be aware of this scam of hidden fees. This may be a good way to get tickets I’d be willing to pay $90 in extra hidden fees that are not disclosed. I requested a detailed billing statement receipt. I could not get one. When I called the customer service line to get help to see exactly what the hidden fees were for all I received was a phone tree message press one, press two, press three, press four but no live operator. Poor customer service. Access fees hidden. No recourse. Please be careful so you are not scammed for an extra $80-$100 in hidden fees."
"Purchased tickets from Vivid Seats for Hamilton in October, 2019. Received a call from vivid seats three days before event that my tickets were cancelled. No real explanation given. Very disappointed!!"
"I recently used the Vivid App to search for tickets for a Florida Panthers hockey game looking for row 1. On the event search, I found a section 128 listed with 6 tickets in row 1. I purchased 4 tickets and waited for delivery. On delivery, I got row 26. I tried calling Customer Service and got pushed to using ""chat"" with a rep named Jose. I explained my situation and he explained that these tickets are marked 'zone seating', which when you read the fine print can be any row (1 to 28) in the section. I asked why was row 1 listed and not 28, as I did my search by row. Jose admitted is could be confusing but said he could not do anything. I asked for a supervisor and he stated all were busy but could try calling by phone. I called and got pushed around the automated system for 5 minutes trying to get a 'human', then hung up."
"We bought Broncos tickets 2 months in advance. Immediately got a confirmation email, everything seemed good. I am not a fan of this whole releasing tickets only a few days before the event, but I've done that with another company in the past and it worked out fine. The confusing part is the actual ticket delivery. They come from a 3rd party email, might be Ticketmaster, might be something else. I overlooked the email when it came 6 days ahead of time (I recognize that this is my fault) as it was pushed to my junk email folder. I had incorrectly assumed that I would be able to get the Vivid Seats app and accept my tickets. Of course, this all became an issue at the last minute when I couldn't find the ""detailed email with instructions to accept tickets."" I searched everything I could think of: ""tickets"" ""broncos"" ""empower field"" ""Ticketmaster"" etc. but they weren't coming up! "
"Tickets were listed at $116 but then I receive an order confirmation via email for a total of $297.20! The ""live chat agent"" explained that I may have missed the fees ""as they become available to view as a link underneath your order total at the top of the checkout page. THE ORDER TOTAL UPDATES FULLY ONCE YOU HAVE ADDED OR DECLINED TICKET INSURANCE."" I placed this order on my phone and the full page wasn't available without scrolling so it's on me because buyer beware. Naturally tickets are not refundable because the order was confirmed and delivered (the email with the total). "
"I ordered tickets to a Colts' game 6 months before the game and have not received them on the day before the game. I’ve called Vivid several times to no avail. The supervisor told me to ‘be patient’. As I explained to him, the other supervisor and the agents I spoke with, I am traveling from the Philadelphia area to Indiana to see the game with my son. When it got to 22 hours before game time I had to do something so I made the decision to dispute the charge and purchase tickets from a legitimate seller, (which I received approximately 3 minutes after ordering)."
"We bought 4 tickets to the Iron Bowl, paid $1500. Was “guaranteed“ the tickets would be sent out by the 23rd. This was cutting it close but was fine given the fact that we were not leaving town until the 26th. I called on Friday and was told again that the tickets would go out on no later than the 23rd and would be to me by the 25th. On the 23rd I checked the status of our tickets and after quite some time I was informed they had in fact NOT been sent. I explained why that was a HUGE problem as my tickets would be delivered in TN a day or more after we were leaving town. They said, ""No problem. We can change the address."" So I changed the address to my Mom's house. She was supposed to get the tickets on Tuesday. I called my Mom Tuesday around 4 and NO TICKETS!!! "
"I was so excited to purchase my tickets, only to find out the next day that my tickets were canceled. It took several phone calls to even get to talk to a person. When I finally got to talk to someone they said they canceled my tickets because for some unknown reason they decided that it was purchased by an authorized user. I entered all the information correctly, said my tickets were ready, so how do they come to this conclusion!!!! I was extremely upset if they thought that they should have called me so I could verify that I was the user. I asked if I could get a discount for my inconvenience and they said no. I finally hung up on them. I would give 0 stars but that wasn't an option. I would NEVER use them again. I am happy for those it worked out for. Good luck in the future. Also, their fees are outrageous."
"I will never use Vivid Seats for any purchase ever again, this has been a horrible experience!!!! Unfortunately I am very limited on income and my Father wanted to go see the Miami Heat play the Warriors on November 29th at the American Airlines Arena. The tickets cost $205.00, I had $250.00 available on my card to make the purchase. They charged my card then sent me the confirmation number. Well a few minutes later they send me an email saying that the tickets were cancelled and an issue will be refunded in 3-5 business days. I will now not have the money in time to get the tickets at the lower price!!!! This company has ruined me surprising my 84 year old father who really looked forward to going to the game!!!!"
"This is a horrible site to purchase tickets! Thought I had 2 to a concert but then got several notices to call - got on extended chat with no help. After 45 minutes they tell me they don’t have those but could get me others - not seats I wanted. Meanwhile, this was supposed to be a surprise which got ruined because of 4 calls!! Went to Ticketmaster and got them. No problem!"
"This is by far the most unprofessional group of individuals managing a corporation. If you have any issues and it needs to be escalated beware!!! They will just dodge you and avoid you and laugh at you, and say ""Good Luck."" They then tell you calls are not recorded, at least the ones of their staff being abusive to you on the phone. This corporation does not conduct themselves professionally. Upper management uses foul language and is abusive to their sellers and or buyers. They deflect any issue, and do not address matters."
"Update:   I did receive my refund and did get a response from the company.  According to the Vivid Seats representative, this was a ""Seller"" issue and the ""Seller"" made the mistake.  The tickets were never available to begin with.    Now, does that excuse them from not verifying the tickets two months ago, instead less than one week before the show?  No.  However, they were very apologetic which goes a long way in my book."
"This company profits on scamming people. It’s a complete fraud of a company. Benefiting on knowing the patterns of event ticket purchasing. They offer no refund, ever, no matter what. I suggest contacting your financial institution to investigate this company."
"I purchased 4 tickets via Vivid Seats to the Tennessee-Vanderbilt football game on November 30th. I specifically picked out tickets for seats in a specific section and row in the football stadium for a lot of reasons. All during the process I was notified by Vivid Seats of the Section and Row my tickets would be in. Today, Vivid Seats emailed to me my tickets to print, listing the Section and Row as I originally agreed to. When I began to print the tickets, I noticed that the Row of the seats was 7 rows different than what I had originally ordered and it was different than the summary email that I received to print the tickets. "
"They offer 10% off first purchases however the discount does not work online. When chatting to them they mentioned the discount does not work online, and will never work. Wants me to call. Scam. Customer service treats you like **. Extremely rude and not helpful. ""You can receive the discount by placing the order over the phone"" is what they say. Disclaimer states in app or online only?"
"We purchased tickets through Vivid Seats, and when we went to 'view tickets' when we arrived to our event, it said we had no tickets. They refused to give us a refund because they said it looked like they went through on their end. I sent screenshots showing we had no tickets, and they said that did not prove anything and still would not give us a refund. $210 for my husband's birthday present gone. Never ever ever ever buy tickets through them."
"We purchased Philadelphia Sixers tickets for Nov. 10 in August. First, we couldn't access the tickets until October which I thought was weird. Second, we got the game and they told us the tickets were in use. We went the box office where they confirmed this and told us not to trust any site except Stub Hub. Third, it's impossible to get in touch with an actual human. They have such a runaround system you keep getting the same messages despite which area you choose to go on the phone. Fourth, they claimed they'd investigate, but they kept trying to call my wife when she was at work, she left messages asking for a call back at another time, they refused to do so and then kept sending e-mails with automated responses that basically left you with nothing. Do not recommend."
"1st time selling tickets after I purchased them on their site. Wanted better seats, so I relisted them. Tickets sold, but customer did not want them because they could not see if the tickets were consecutive. I assumed a customer could see them and pick which seats they wanted. I was called by VS customer service, and rudely scolded and told I was being fined $230!!! This is after I already paid for the tickets and even bought 4 new ones, so they got 8 ticket purchases from me and STILL FINED ME!!! Never buy from these guys. Customer Service might be the worst I have ever encountered. Use Stubhub. They seem to actually care about their customers."
"I purchased (2) tickets to Charlie Berens for $43ea. They can be purchased directly through the casino he is at for $20, but we thought we'd pay the extra to be a few rows further toward the stage. I was shocked when I hit ""purchase"" and I was charged $121.33. They were shipped standard UPS ground and printed on typing paper. I immediately tried calling them to cancel but couldn't get through to a live person. The invoice they e-mailed has no breakdown of what I was charged and why. I called after they arrived and finally got a live person. He said that the website makes note of the extra fees somewhere. I asked multiple times what I was charged for, and he could not tell me. They would not refund anything. This is such a scam."
"I purchased club seats for the Browns vs Bills and received mezzanine seats which do not come with any of the perks that club seats get. I explained this several times to Vivid Seat's representatives and they basically blew me off with terrible answers. The 100% customer satisfaction guarantee is totally untrue. I paid for club seats and was expecting to sit in seats that were not in the rain. Luckily it did not rain too much - otherwise, that would have made the experience even worse. Stay away from Vivid Seats would be my advice."
"We purchased Luke Combs' tickets for an out of state show, almost four months before the show. We incurred costs for plane tickets, hotel, rental car, concert parking and when our tickets were scanned at the door we were told someone else already entered with our tickets. The concert was sold out and there was nothing the venue could do. Vivid said they will only refund the ticket cost and ""sorry for the inconvenience "". Our loss is over $1500 because they send our duplicate tickets which is more than an inconvenience."
"Maybe I am just the (un)lucky buyer. I bought 8 seats to the NHL Winter Classic 2020. Vivid will NOT provide me an e-ticket via their app. They have only sent me a link to download the PDFs. Well, I can't validate these are legit, and I'd rather not find out the day of the event at the Cotton Bowl. I promised 4 of them for sale BEFORE buying off Vivid, but no other reseller will recognize or list them. AND VIVID REFUSES TO SELL THEM FOR ME EITHER! So, I can't sell them, I can't validate them, but I'm out over $1,000! Vivid chat says ""they're fine."" SeatGeek and StubHub says ""not."""
"I missed The Stones concert due to a hurricane, lost $6,616.74. My first mistake was buying such an expensive ticket for The Rolling Stones on impulse but it was the only one left in my chosen section at the time. The concert was in April but got changed to August 31,2019. Then when the hurricane Dorian made the news the Stones changed the date to August 30, 2019. I got the email for this change at 9pm August 29! I was ready to go, flying from California to Miami, even had my boarding passes. However as I watched the Weather Channel I realized that I would be flying into an area where the hurricane was expected to make landfall. Being from California I do not know how to stay safe in hurricanes. I had no idea what to expect. I also began to realize that I would most likely be stuck there because flights in and out of Miami were canceled for that weekend. "
"Try to find a live person to help you. It took me a half an hour to try and get through the phone system without luck, sent an email to customer support then tried live chat. Horrible customer service. Be aware that tickets are not issued until the day before or day of an event, so it makes it almost impossible to sell them. When we first purchased the tickets I spent an hour trying to get through to someone as to why we couldn't get our tickets as soon as they were purchased only to end up with the live chat. Now I know why they don't issue them right away, because it makes it impossible to sell if you have to! The funniest thing is that I can't sell the tickets through Vivid tickets that I purchased through Vivid. Seriously? The reason why is because I don't have the physical tickets! Arggghhhh! Good luck purchasing through them. Ended up paying a sky high price for tickets to not even be able to sell them!"
"Purchased tickets for REO Speedwagon for November 9th, 2019 for the Four Winds Casino venue. I received the tickets through email. I was able to print the tickets. We drove over an hour away and booked a hotel room. Going into the venue, our tickets would not scan. We got sent to a supervisor and he told us our tickets were invalid, and the seller probably sold those tickets more than once. The show was sold out. So, we made the trip, paid for tickets that were invalid and paid for a hotel room, all for nothing."
"I booked a show from 8pm and never received a confirmation email. On the day of, I checked my tickets and they were for 3pm and I already missed it. Turns out an 8pm show never existed in the first place, yet they still posted it. I asked for a refund and they refused even though they could not prove I booked that 3pm show. You’re taking a major risk if you book from these guys. Be safe and avoid."
"We drove 5 hours on a Friday afternoon and evening, paid over $60 for parking and waited in the cold for 4 ticketS and almost $1500 nosebleed section seats at Hamilton only to get as far as the lobby and told that none of the tickets were valid. The show was sold out. Vivid Seats could not ""reach"" the ""owner. But a supervisor will contact me sometime in the next two days to START their investigation"". 0 stars and will NEVER trust."
"This app is a scam. I was charged the money for my tickets and didn’t receive them. When calling customer service they were snarky, demeaning and unhelpful. They ended up charging me a $90 fee because the sale of my tickets fell through....because they never sent me the tickets to begin with. One of the worst programs and support I’ve dealt with. DO NOT USE!!!"
"If you make a mistake when purchasing a ticket at Vivid, they will not help you. I purchased tickets for Friday instead of Thursday. I called them the same day to see if they could help. They told me to go sell my tickets on Google in a very thick and hard to understand accent. I asked them if they could sell my tickets or exchange them for another time. I kept on hearing NO NO NO. It was really a special event but they simply did not care. They read a policy and told me good bye. No sympathy or assistance or thoughtful suggestions. It is really awful how they treat people and how bad their customer service is. Plus their representatives were really hard to understand. So buyer beware, stay away from this group. They have no sense of service, do not help and do not care. I have found much better service on Stubhub and Ticketmaster. Vivid is a big disappointment."
"Well, I am elated to say that I am one of those who had a positive purchasing experience with Vivid Seats. That being said, I did pay $640 total for two floor seats to the recent Tool concert at US BANK ARENA. However, they were transferred over on 10/30 as promised (Ticketmaster didn’t release them until 10/29, so 10/30 was perfectly reasonable) and they did in fact scan correctly at venue."
"I purchased tickets from Vividseats.com for a playoff game at Yankee stadium. I was told that the seller would be emailing me the tickets which eventually happened. However this was just the beginning of my problems with Vividseats.com. This was the second set of tickets that I purchased for this event (the first arrived with no problems). Once I received an email stating that I would be able to download the tickets, I tried and was given a message stating that the tickets were not ready and to contact customer service. I tried to email, call and live chat with vividseats.com in order to download the tickets. By this time I was already on the train and close to the stadium. Every way I tried contacting vividseats.com kept giving me generic prerecorded statements. After waiting outside the stadium for an hour, I was forced to go to Stubhub.com and purchase additional tickets so that I could watch the rest of the game."
I was trying to buy tickets for a event and thought I was getting a reasonable price. Right before I was at the end my tickets went up over $100. I hit back because I wasn’t going to purchase them. Somehow my tickets were confirmed. I messaged them right away to tell them what happened - they refused to help me. If you are so confident in your value/service you should not have to trick people with hidden fees. I will not use their service again.
After purchasing tickets through PayPal Vivid Seats sent an email stating they need further verification of my identity and to send a picture in jpg format of my drivers licence/credit card/and to provide a PayPal account number. Enrique from the verification dept. stated I could cover up my drivers license number and signature. All they needed was an expiry date to verify I was the customer. Then he proceeds to tell me he has other customers waiting and couldn't proceed with my call when I still had questions. Customer service could only take my feedback and said they had never heard of the verification dept. needing a picture of my id. Crossing fingers that I receive my refund. Beware.
I ordered 2 Fleetwood Mac tickets section 224 row N. I hit purchase and they sent me a confirmation for section 202 row M. I called within minutes of placing the order and receiving the wrong seats. They said they could do nothing about it. I could sell the tickets and buy new ones!!! So you order an orange and they give you an apple and say tough. I will never use them again!!!!
"I purchased tickets to Cardi B concert 4 months in advance using my PayPal Credit account. $1300. Cardi B cancelled the concert 30 mins before it was scheduled to start. I immediately called Vivid Seats to request a refund and was told it was not their problem, that they didn't provide refunds. I was so upset because of the amount of money I paid for the tickets. Nor myself or any of the other ticket holders could attend the ""rescheduled"" date due to other obligations and Vivid Seats still would not honor us a refund. They ""stole"" $1300 from me and convinced PayPal Credit not to honor me a refund as well."
Purchased tickets through Vivid. It was a scam. The seller sold the tickets elsewhere and I have evidence from Ticketmaster that I never received my tickets and that my tickets were invalid the day of the event. Their 100% buyer guarantee is a fraud. They refused to give me my money back. They refused to answer my questions and said they have a no refund policy even when I fell under the the buyer guarantee policy. STAY AWAY.
"I bought tickets for Ed Sheeran with my platinum Amex last year for his show in Kansas City. I never received the tickets by mail or email. When I looked through my phone on the day of the concert after flying from New York to KC, I had spent $900 and had no tickets. So, I called “customer service”. They told me that my tickets were from a third party and that there was nothing they could do. After two hours of trying to solve it, I called American Express and explained everything. They refunded my money. Then, I tried to buy tickets to Seinfeld in NYC. Again, the day of, I get an email saying my tickets were cancelled. I called “customer service”. They said I had submitted a buyback, so from now on my orders would be cancelled! So, I was screwed again! I despise this company. They are thieves!!!"
"I purchased hockey tickets from Groupon last night and got an email this morning from Vivid Seats that the tickets were not available and that I'd get a refund in 3-5 business days. What kind of BS is that? You take my money, get confirmation on the seats and then the next day you tell me they are not available?? Never will I do business again with them. Groupon should never use them as their ticketing partner."
"I ordered and paid for 2 tickets to an event that was to start at 7:30 p.m. on 10/18/19. At about 6:50 p.m. the night of the event I still had not received my tickets so I called Vivid Seats. I spoke with an agent who said he would help get the tickets sent electronically. I was on the phone with him for over 35 minutes without any success in receiving the tickets, until at 7:32 p.m. "
"I purchased tickets to an event and was patiently waiting on my ""Transfer"" tickets from the reseller. The same day of the event I became a bit worried because I had not received my tickets. Only hours away from the concert & I could not speak with anyone at Vivid Seats. I tried chatting but the automated chat was not helpful. I receive a call from a rep finally, to tell me there was a mistake and the reseller sent my tickets to another email (WTF!) but that I should not worry because I was getting better upgraded seats at no additional cost. I was glad, as I mentioned to the rep my drive to this concert is at least 2 hours. "
Bought tickets for an event and it got postponed. I could not attend the new date so call to get a refund. Nope. They don't do that. They will tell you to either resell the tickets or give them to a friend. What kind of company won't back what they are selling? I could see if the date didn't get changed and I just wanted cancel but that's not the case. The event got change to a date 3 months down the road.
You will never get the email with the actual tickets!! And when you call for a refund they keep telling you you got it. And then they will tell you they have proof the people send you the ticket and it's not their fault if you never got them.
I purchased tickets to the big game for this upcoming weekend and they allow the seller to resell my tickets and offered me a less visible seat in a completely different section than what I paid for. They would not honor the original section or seats that I paid for and they are not doing anything to the seller who created this situation in the first place. Buyer beware. If you don’t mind sitting in less valuable seats and paying a higher price for your original seat then go ahead and do business with this company otherwise stay away.
"I've been a Vivid Seats customer for several years now and have never had an issue with them until this last time that I purchased tickets. As a gift to my parents for their Anniversary I bought them tickets to a baseball game that were 1 section over/same row as us. When they got to the game and actually opened the tickets to scan them, we saw that the tickets we purchased were completely different to what they gave us. Instead of 1 section over from us, they were 9 sections over. When I called Vivid Seats to complain and ask for a refund or at least a discount I was told they would not do that due to them being able to give you tickets of the same value or an upgrade. Since when is this ok? So let's deceive our customers into thinking they're getting a great seat and then sending them something else. Total RIPOFF!!"
"After purchasing tickets for a big time playoff game, I never received the ""delivery"" email. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with customer service. Long story short, I never got the tickets. Never again!"
I lost my ticket and no one could help me. They refused to get the seller to reprint or reissue so I was out of luck. And I paid over 3 times the price for a seat. I don't know why they don't hold their sellers more accountable as they are a 1.5 billion dollar company.
I purchased tickets advertised through Groupon. At no point did the seller indicate they were standing room only SRO till after I received the tickets. Neither Vivid Seats nor Groupon would refund. I have a medical condition that does not permit me to stand. If I knew tickets were for standing I would not purchase. Buyer beware. This group is a ripoff. $125 USD to stand.
"I accidentally bought 2 sets of tickets through Vivid seats. I decided to sell them for the 1st time on their platform. I am a first time seller so I was not aware of how the process worked. Listing the tickets were really easy. However, when the tickets sold, I was told that I was not able to sell the tickets on their platform because of the type of tickets that they were and that they would have to contact the buyer and arrange for the sale to be cancelled. "
"I purchased two tickets to the Yankees Twins game. The game was 10/5 and I bought the tickets on 9/16. They took my money easily enough but then the problems began. On 9/18 I received an email from their seller telling me to click the link to accept the tickets. I clicked the link and it kept saying, ""Oops something's wrong on our end. Please try again."" I then contacted customer service on 9/19 and told them what the issue was. They were unable to help and furthermore told me that the seller had delivered the tickets to me and there was nothing they could do. I called every day until 1 hour before the game. They kept telling me that the tickets were confirmed delivered by the seller. But they weren’t. They continued to protect the scam artist seller. "
"Purchased tickets and seats weren't together, called and they said I could sell tickets and buy more. Paid 4k for 5 tickets tickets and that's the services you get! Thought I paid double the price so tickets would be together but consumer apparently is always wrong! Tried to go through online customer service and gave order number. They replied back 3 days later with wrong order number and wrong name?"
I purchased tickets through their website. I received an email confirmation and my credit card was charged. Believing that I had the tickets I went on with my day. I checked my email later and they had cancelled my order. When contacting customer service they could not tell me why the order was cancelled other than some information could not be verified (despite having my correct credit card information and my email address). Ticket prices had nearly doubled since my original purchase and their response could be summed up as better luck next time. At one point one of their representatives hung up on me because I was not satisfied with their non-answer answers. I would never use their services again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so either.
"Never could speak to human. Website fraudulent. Never use this company!! Said tickets already taken by other user. Immediately bought other tickets, then received email that I had purchased both. Tried for an hour to speak with live person to no success. Online chat useless."
I listed a game parking ticket for the first time. I reached out (via public info) to ask if buyer preferred hand delivery a few blocks away. Now am being charged not paid; mgmt won't even take calls.
"This company sold us tickets and then took them away a few weeks later. Apparently they never actually owned or had the tickets, and the true owner decided to do something else with them. Very sketchy. They had already provided the tickets to our mobile device, which they revoked when this happened, so we called them to see what our options were. They offered us a free upgrade to better tickets, which sounded great, but then after accepting the better tickets they told us they didn't have those tickets either - and that we wouldn't see them until a week before the event."
"I have 4 children and could not find parking for the Eagles opener. My son went on VIVID to order get a parking pass for $200. Yes $200 he mistaking put in the wrong email address. He and I tried calling VIVID to try and correct the mistake. We kept getting a pop up window to chat. The pop up window was useless. By 11:00 on Monday we finally got a live person on the phone. Her response was, ""Sunday is our busiest day and we are understaffed."" She was laughing on the phone and said, ""Too bad we have a no refund policy."" The customer support person could care less. We never got to use the parking pass and lost $200. We are disputing it. Their position is we should have read the no refund T&C's. I will take them to small claims court. Very unreputable company. Never use VIVID."
"I have had the same issues that multiple others have been having regarding not receiving tickets. I ordered two sets of tickets for the Eagles vs Falcons game on September 15, 2019. The first set came through just fine with a an email providing a link from Ticketmaster that I had to download the tickets through an electronic transfer. I received an email that my second set of tickets were delivered and to follow the link provided to download the tickets, which did not work. I called Vivid Seats and the person walked me through how to do it, I tried following his instructions but it did not work, the guy kept walking me through it and eventually hung up on me. I spent over 6 hours with Vivid Seats customer service on the phone, through chat, and email to try and get refunded for the tickets I never received. "
"They charged my card for tickets they said I ordered which I didn't. Thankfully, I received an email from the ticket source asking me to ""accept"" the tickets, which I quickly declined and received an email saying they were declined. Vivid Seats didn't issue me a credit for the charge so I contacted their customer service. They said I accepted the tickets and therefore was on the hook for the charges. They said my only option was to try to resell the tickets. I told them I didn't order the tickets and even so they were declined so there was nothing to sell. "
"I spoke with customer service/ chat regarding an issue I was having selling my tickets. They were rude, and not useful at all. I work in customer support, if I spoke that way to my customers I would not have a job. I advised them to place more information on their site and they said they wont. Overall experience was not worth it to try and sell the tickets I no longer needed. Wont buy from them again."
"I’m never one to complain, but Vivid Seats literally has no customer service. They were 36 hours late on an e-ticket (yes the same ones you can instantly download from StubHub). Normally this wouldn’t have been a problem, but my friend backed out of going. It sure would have been nice to be able to sell that ticket instead of getting it an hour before the game. No apology, credit or nothing. If that’s the kind of customer service you want, go for it. It’s cheap for a reason."
"In fact I’m not going to use them again. Thinking back on last Opening Day I didn’t get my tickets until late the day prior. I was pissed 'cuz I had to do it on an actual computer not just a cellphone. I was already up in the city so it was good my hotel was able to let me access one but I was really upset. Nope NOT using them again for sure!! PLUS I called them several time before I left to tell them I was still waiting only for them to say.... ""Oh you should get them soon!"" Also I bought Andrea Bocelli tickets through them then about three weeks later they told me they weren’t available and wanted to give me nosebleed for the same price but I got a refund."
It’s too bad I can’t put 0 stars. I ordered tickets same day as event and it took a hour to get the confirmation email. When I finally did the link did not work. I called and they told me that they did what they were supposed to and would not give a refund for a “troubleshoot” issue. They said Ticketmaster MIGHT give me a refund. Ticketmaster wasn’t the one I have the money to or did any business with. The representative was very rude and finally to get me off the phone offered $70 credit which wasn’t even a third of what I paid for the tickets. I declined because I will never use this company again.
"They will not give you tickets at time of purchase and say you will get them 48 hours out. When we did not receive our tickets at the designated time, we began calling them. At one point they sent calls from my husband's cell directly to automated answering. We used my cell phone and got right through. Two hours before game time, we wanted our money back and we were referred to a supervisor who got huffy and said, ""You didn't need to talk to me to get a refund!"" They purchase tickets from a third party, get commission, and screw you if the ticket is from a fraudulent individual. I reported them to my credit card company. Crooks."
"The experience started well, taking my money and sending confirmation went smoothly. Apparently, according to Darren, (top of the escalation chain as the first representative was unable to do anything other than record the issue details twice), sending confirmation and a second email containing a URL to retrieve the purchased parking pass is the totality of their perceived responsibility. When clicking on the aforementioned URL, logging onto the Ticketmaster website and clicking on show details to reveal the parking pass bar code the page turned, revealed an empty page with the words ""no details"". Darren's solution was to advise me to contact Ticketmaster! I told him my purchase and contract was with Vivid, not Ticketmaster and their failure in electronic data exchange was not my problem. This is where the call ended. "
"If you have to be sent to YouTube to watch a video on how to retrieve your purchased tickets, then there is a problem. Vivid Seats is a complete joke. Complicated and complex. Who has time for this kind of nonsense! How about just purchasing online and being sent an email to confirm your purchase and be done with it. I will never use Vivid Seats for future events. I give this site a ZERO."
"Scam Company! On September 17th, I purchased a $100 ticket to the Titans at Falcons, then received an confirmation email saying the tickets will be sent once the seller confirms the order. It also said I can look up the action on my Vivid Seats account, which I did. Said it was pending confirmation from the seller, and now the game is tomorrow and I never got the ticket. I looked back at the 17th in my email history and the confirmation email didn't even exist anymore, and the order didn't exist on my Vivid Seats account anymore either! So I went on my Bank account and saw that I still got charged for the ticket on the 17th. I tried to call Vivid Seats, no Customer Service. I spent an hour trying to get a live person. It's not possible, so Vivid Seats literally stole my money!"
If I could rate 0 stars I would. Spent almost $700 on 3 seats and delivery totally messed up. Found it impossible to speak to a human and chat option inane. The whole process of electronic delivery is unnecessarily complex and poorly designed involving linking to multiple websites and emails from unknown sellers that end up in spam. No help when there are questions. At least with Stubhub you have the tickets in your hand or on your phone at least a week in advance and you can get them on the phone.
"Horrible experience with Vivid Seats! I purchased tickets to an NFL game and then went to another site to see on a stadium map where exactly the row was. I found out that the row for those seats did not exist. An email from the Manager of Ticket Sales at the stadium verified that there was no such row in that section. Vivid Seats, through a chat session agreed that there was no such row and that the seller would have to correct the error or the purchase price would be refunded and that I would be notified shortly. I was not notified shortly of anything. "
I bought a parking pass for $65 in the Orange lot at Metlife Stadium. When I got there I was told the lot was full and then I tried another lot and it was full. I ended up having to park in the parking garage for another $45. I called Vivid Seats and went round and round with their customer support. After 2 weeks they offered me a credit of $14 because $51 went directly to the seller. I told them to keep their credit because I will not ever by from Vivid Seats again.
Vivid Seats resells very expensive tickets that you can find at least half the price from any decent resellers... And don't count on the customer support to answer any of your requests. I'll never ever buy anything from them.
"I purchased Skynyrd tickets the week they went on sale. $1500 for two VIP tickets. The process only allowed the next best available. The seats were the farthest right you could possibly get, couldn’t see the stage and the devastating part was the people sitting next to us paid $130 for two seats! Definitely did NOT get what I paid for. We watched the concert on the screens! NEVER using Vivid again! Think twice and research other companies before purchasing from Vivid! It was a distressing, disappointing evening!"
"When you place your ticket on checking out, you can not see any delivery date before you pay. On that page, you will have a option to pay several dollars for refund service. After you pay, you will see the delivery date is one day before your event. When you try to contact customer service 4-5 times, you will get contact with one rude agent who says you cannot do anything and we cannot give you refund. LOL REALLY A DISGUSTING WEBSITE I HAVE EVER SEEN. How does this website survive until now???"
"Vivid Seats sent us tickets that didn't look valid, small stubs. We browsed Seahawks web site and saw they went 100% mobile. That increased our suspicions. We worked with Seahawks support to determine the tickets we received from Vivid Seats were invalid.. a scam from the seller. Luckily we determined this before trying to use them and get rejected at the gate. Vivid Seats has a guarantee that seats are valid or your money back. They refuse to respond. I'm emailing daily with proof the tickets are invalid, no response. You can't call them to ask for a manager, no number posted to call. Their chat is non-existent, sat there for 30 minutes, no live chat response. There's a reason you can't post reviews on their site. BBB is my only option. Crooks. I would avoid at all costs."
Kid Rock ticket. This has to be the crappiest company I have ever used. Purchased 1 tix over on 8/15/19 and still haven't received my ticket yet as of 1 pm EST on 9/19/19. The concert is tomorrow. I wouldn't use this crappy company ever again and would recommend everyone to not use this company. Terrible customer service.
"I guess I should have read the reviews about this company before spending $700 on tickets for a concert. Purchased tickets back on 5/8/2019. Received confirmation email of ticket purchase and email stating my tickets would be available 9/15/2019 via electronic transfer, 2 days before my event. I did not receive my tickets and called the day of the event stating so. I called the first stating the problem I was having, the woman was friendly, asked for an alternate email in case that was the issue and told me they had contacted the seller and the seller was going to resend my tickets, if I had not received them 1 hour after the phone call...call again. 1 hour later, no tickets, call again and the second man I spoke to again was apologetic and told me again that the seller was resending my tickets, if I didn’t hear or receive an email call back again in 1 hour."
"Bought $1200 worth of tickets on Vivid Seats 2 weeks ago. Now three days before the event I need to resale some in advance due to a death in the family. But, Vivid says they don’t possess or control delivery of the tickets they sell AND now the tickets they sold me aren’t eligible for resale anyway!! You can’t actually talk to a human being in customer service. Just a bad, bad process. Don’t give them your money!!"
I bought 4 tickets to the Rolling Stone concert in Miami Fl for April 20th 2019. The show was rescheduled for Aug 31st 2019. I paid $937.48 for 4 tickets and was willing to wait 'til Aug 31st but Hurricane Dorian was approaching and one day's notice moved it to Aug 30th. We could not attend because of the approaching hurricane. We live in Cocoa Beach FL and are over 3 hrs away and Florida declared a State of Emergency. Called Vivid Seats for a refund and was told because the show was rescheduled I can't get a refund. I also bought insurance through PayPal from Allianz Global Assistance and they too said to go through where I bought my tickets. Talked to the top guy Brandon **. and he was really no help. So bottom line do not buy tickets from Vivid Seats. They are not a reputable co.
"I put tickets to the Old Dominion University - University of Virginia game in the cart to see how much they would cost. The price was too high, so I closed the window without making a purchase. Imagine my surprise when I saw that my bank had withdrawn $192.50 for an order I never completed. They told me that it is impossible to get a refund. Avoid Vivid Seats at all cost!"
"Whatever you do, Do not buy tickets here from this site. The seller usually doesn’t buy tickets from the vendor until last minute which means you don’t get your tickets until last minute....if you get your tickets. This seller was late 3 times so far delivering my tickets and the agents lied to me twice of a refund but with a constant run around. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!! StubHub is better."
"You cannot transfer electronic ticket. I purchased ticket 3/30/19. Still on the phone with them after chatting 3 time and on the phone still no tickets. They do not care and always give and this people never help you. The customer service is from overseas and they don't own what to do and when you pass that you will be chat with a machine. For me I will pay more for not need to deal with this people ever again. TRUST ME. DON'T GET TICKETS FROM THIS SITE, YOU WILL BE VERY MAD."
"On June 29, 2019 I bought 2 tickets on your website for the Rolling Stones concert that occurred last Friday, August 30, 2019 on Hard Rock Stadium, Miami – FL. These 2 tickets together cost me more than a thousand dollars. On the day of the show, I had a really bad surprise on the entrance of the stadium. When I tried to use my tickets, the security told that those where “invalid tickets”, and that they were probably fake. I was told to go to the ticket center on Hard Rock Stadium to try to solve this embarrassing situation. It was raining a lot at the moment; I got my fiancé and ran to this ticket office hoping not to lose the concert."
Could not access my tickets for 1 hour after the Metallica S&M concert in Chase Center. The app didn’t work! No ticket was there. Called and emailed multiple times and received no help from customer service. The next day I called and their representative had no reasonable response about the issue. They said it’s the bank fault!
"I usually use other services, so I have a benchmark. I gave Vivid Seats a try, and it failed miserably. First of all, once I created a listing, it did not automatically show up in the search results for the show. I had to speak to customer service. The associate did not give me any explanations and did not apologize, but the listing was activated. However, Vivid Seats has a weird policy that ticket listings automatically expire every few hours. It's ridiculous. The day of the show, when most people shop for tickets, the listing has to be manually renewed every 4 hours. Who wants to be checking on their listings every few hours on the day of their Broadway trip? Not me. And even that wasn't the most frustrating part. "
I purchased concert tickets 3 months prior. Delivery was guaranteed week of concert. Been on phone 3 consecutive days before concert with no promised callbacks. Day of concert today. Still no ticket and refusal to refund.
"I purchased tickets for a Mets-Phillies game on July 7th. When I tried to enter the stadium with my wife, we were denied entry and told we had to go to customer service. They told us that someone had already entered with our tickets. So the seller sold them twice. While I understand Vivid Seats is not the seller, they should hold themselves more responsible for the tickets they sell. It was a very poor experience and ruined our day."
Took me almost to game time to get my seats. Total runaround by incompetent representatives. They acted like it was my fault. Had to charge back on my credit card and file a BBB complaint to get them to respond.
"I purchased ticket from them against my better judgement months ago. Besides the HUGE gauge they call a service charge, I couldn't see what seat numbers I was getting, only the row (not even a section). Now three days before the show, I get a text saying the tickets have been transferred. Transferred where??? They make Ticketbastard look good by comparison. They don't even deserve a star, but you can't rate no stars or I would."
"After I bought the tickets, the link sent me to another site which I was locked out of. I then had no choice but to reject the tickets, even though I first accepted it. They were nice on the phone but told me my it was my tough luck, that other site is my problem, and I rejected the tix. They don't really sell tickets, they just send you to a link to login to the sellers account. If you don't have an account there, that's your problem."
"In the previous reviews people said they talked to an actual person at Vivid Seats. I'd like to know how they did that, because after 2 weeks of calling, e-mailing, texting I have gotten only recordings or no response at all. I bought tickets to the Bears game in London. The tickets will arrive at my house (at best) on Tuesday of that week when I'll be on the plane on my way to London. I've tried repeatedly to contact them to either cancel, or redirect the delivery with no results. Consequently I'm out $400.00. The tickets are high, the service fees are exorbitant, customer service does not exist."
Do not buy tickets from them. If something goes wrong with your event they will NOT support you. They are unscrupulous. Please trust me on this one. There are plenty of others places to get tickets from.
"Bought tickets for Sept 8 game cardinals vs lions, thought everything went well. Got email confirmation my card was charged so I assumed all was good. Wrong. Not even ten minutes later my tickets are canceled and I can’t get my money back to purchase tickets elsewhere for 3 to 5 business days. So my kids are without watching the game now thanks to Vivid Seats. Lesson learned. Next time will go through Seat Geek like I normally do."
"I ordered tickets for a concert in September, in August. I received an email saying that I will be receiving a confirmation email. I have been on the phone with Vivid Seats since August 26th till today September 5th. My concert is on September 7th and I still have not received my tickets. I am on hold now for a supervisor for 1/2. No one has come to the phone. Was told to create an account in Live Nation and Ticket Master and nothing is there. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE MY OPINION AND MY REALITY."
"Bought tix for Bruno Mars concert in Vegas. Taken off the line with a claim that the tix I had purchased were fraudulent. Mandalay Bay made good on the purchase otherwise I would have been out of $650. I will never ever deal with this company and I urge anyone wanted to deal with them, to reconsider."
"I purchased two sets of 3 tickets each to Elton John. Within minutes all 6 tickets were canceled. In the email it said that I withheld payment in past to them or another competitor. I spoke with a senior customer service agent that day. He told me my only recourse was to email support@vividseats.com. I have done this every day and received zero response! Today, 4 days later I spoke with another senior customer service agent. She told me that it is up to their discretion if they ever want to contact me or accept another ticket order again. I have never withheld payment to them or any competitor, I have perfect credit and am totally disgusted with their lack of customer service. Never do business with them!!!"
"Purchased tickets on line. Read the information. Was ""linked"" via the AK State fair to this organization and didn't realize I had any other choice. Ticket price was originally $40 + $6.00 fee. AFter reviewing my invoice and AFTER I compared the tickets realized the HUGE charges. They had increased the tickets to $51.00, charged a service fee of $7.90, then added on a Delivery Fee (online mind you) of $26+.....My ticket price went from what should have been $92.00 for 2 tickets to $126.28. There was also apparently a ""discount"" of -$10 something. Nonetheless, got no good support from them. I am calling the AK Fair and advising NOT TO USE THIS VENDOR. TOTAL RIP OFF."
"I purchased tickets for the wrong date. Within seconds I contacted them and they reported they were unable to provide a refund. Although they acknowledged that no tickets would be provided to me and understood that I errantly purchased tickets for the wrong date, they said they would not send tickets to me but would still charge me full price for 4 tickets. Shame on you Vivid Seats for having such horrific refund policy. Unethical and terrible business practice."
"Purchased tickets in May 2019 for an event in Canfield, OH on Labor Day. Watched for email from VIVID SEATS three days before event. Received email from a John somebody with Ticketmaster. Didn't open because I didn't recognize sender. Called VIVID. Told me that those were my tickets. Could not download Ticketmaster App. Spend an hour on Live Chat with snippy person who assured me the tickets would be at the venue ""On Call."" Went there today to pick them up. Not there. Pleaded with ticket counter to print them for me as I was unable to open App. Will NEVER EVER buy tickets from VIVID SEATS again nor Ticketmaster. Horrible, stressful experience. Thankfully, person at fair booth was able to print tickets for me."
"They finally sent the tickets 15 minutes before the show. After a total of 20 plus emails with 2 different emails they came through at the last minute. However, I'm not 100% certain I'll use them again. I've purchased airline tickets electronically much easier than tickets from them."
"Since our event was within 24 hours of purchase, we had to confirm our order over the phone within an hour of purchase using a phone number listed in one of our order detail emails (which we did!). We even received a confirmation email thanking us for our phone call after we completed ticket confirmation. Hours later at 11:43pm, we received an email stating that our event order was canceled. I called customer service immediately and spoke to two agents. They both told me that there was nothing they could do because their system said that we had never called to confirm our tickets, even though we had email and phone history as proof. Since it is so late the night prior to the event, there were no listings with comparable prices and seats, nor were our original tickets re-listed for re-purchase. Vivid Seats did not offer any kind of help to fix our problem when their system ruined our day and now left us without tickets last minute."
"Vivid Seats lies about their service, they should be banished. Was promised entrance into Washington State Fairgrounds with paid Keith Urban ticket, once we got to the event, we found out we had to pay entrance fee, Vivid Seats is a RIP OFF, pleaase stay away!!!!"
I bought tickets for an event and the seller was misleading as to the type of tickets they were. I have never been to a show at the particular venue but there was a VIP section and GA and VIP Platinum. So I was looking at 2 listings. One said VIPBAL indicating it was a VIP balcony seat and the one I ultimately wound up buying which said VIPGA VIP general admission? Well since GA was on the floor I assumed these were VIP on the floor nothing indicated otherwise. And these were more expensive.
Could not access my tickets and received no help from customer service.. All they did was tell me who I should call or contact... They do not offer any refunds or exchanges!! Buyer beware!!!! I would not buy from this site ever again! NO STARS!!
"The fact that I could not, as their service implies, resell my ticket because they ""do not yet have the capability to resell tickets through the phone app,"" should not make me responsible for the amount listed below. I tried over and over to get in touch with their terrible customer service a half hour wait two times, only to have your rep say to me, ""you can't resell the ticket with your phone,"" I can't?!?! Then they had the gall to say ""google how to resell it in some other way."" Are you kidding me?!?! Then you have the nerve to charge me when I could not fulfill my obligation to the guy who wanted to buy my ticket. This is called theft. In reality I got the real answer eventually, but it still DID not help. ""We can only have ""authorized resellers resell tickets."" Really?!?! That is not what the implication of your service is."
"You cannot transfer electronic ticket. Almost missing my game and this people never help you. The customer service is from overseas and they don't own what to do and when you pass that you will be chat with a machine. For me I will pay more for not need to deal with this people ever again. TRUST ME. DON'T GET TICKETS FROM THIS SITE, YOU WILL BE VERY MAD."
"Extremely unprofessional experience - refused to escalate my concerns to more senior customer service professionals. I recently had spinal fusion surgery and pulmonary embolisms preventing me from attending a future event. Vivid Seats told me they didn't have a seller for my tickets yet (i.e. they hadn't bought my tickets yet because they could not find a seller), and I offered to pay them a commission to cancel the order since I couldn't attend the event. I even offered to let them name their number. They refused to speak with me about it after I waited on the phone to speak with someone for 68 minutes."
"I find their inability to answer a phone with the fees they charge per ticket to be one of the WORST examples of customer service around. When I bought tickets they were all about taking to me. But now that they have my money, they only have digital Betty ready to ask STUPID questions without answering a single one! Then they send a survey WITHOUT answering my questions!"
"If you’re thinking about purchasing tickets from this company, don’t! For starters the tickets are way overpriced. I purchased tickets for the Las Vegas Summer League games for 1 day and for two tickets the final price came out to be 158 dollars, when the actual event itself was selling two tickets for a final price of 57 dollars. But even with the overpricing problem of the tickets that’s still not the problem! While I was on the phone with the agent, I asked him multiple times when the game started, and he claimed he looked it up. He told me that the game started at 9pm. However, when my mom and I got to the Thomas and Mack Center at 9pm the event was over. There was not a time of the event on the tickets they sent us nor was it a time on the website, so I was relying on what the agent of this company claimed he looked up and verified."
I purchased Lions tickets on 7-12-2019 for a preseason game at Ford Field. It was for Friday August 23 against the Buffalo Bills. This was a birthday present for my other half. We received a section number row number but no seat number. I tried the week before was on phone for 2 hours would get them couple days before. I tried 2 days before by chat and got they would be sent. NOTHING. So we went down to Ford Field (first time there) with our e-mail. Paid fifty dollars for parking. The email was of no use. But we were able to get tickets again. Never use this company again. Would not even give them 1 star.
Ordered Styx tickets on May for a show on August 25th. Never received the tickets. And in fact they resold our row 2 seats for over 900.00 U.S. and didn't inform us. They claimed that they had to move us to row 18 Because of an obstructed view. The tix were purchased back in May for 100.00 U.S. each. Nothing but a bunch of scalpers. We're now out hundreds of dollars in flights and accommodation. Horrible and disappointing experience.
"I wish I was able to give no stars for this. I have always bought my tickets from Vivid, a great company up until last night. First off, my boyfriend bought tickets for Florida Georgia Line on Aug 22, they sent him the wrong tickets for FGL Aug 10, Vivid resent us tickets for the correct date. We go all the way to DTE, spend $50 in food and $25 in gas. We are in line waiting to get into the concert and all for nothing because the workers say our tickets were invalid. We try and contact Vivid, and there was still no communication. For a night of spending $400 in tickets, $50 in food, $25 in gas, and taking the night off of work to deal with this. It would be great if we were reimbursed for this headache, and tickets to September 8th for Florida Georgia Line. I never want to experience this ever again."
"I purchased two tickets for Raconteurs, and after I downloaded the link I found that the tickets sent were for a different band and different date. I contacted the customer service the same day, and none of the representatives including Senior Customer Care Service representative offered any help. They did not want neither to replace nor reimburse these tickets. All they said, as well as a prerecorded message suggested to sell these tickets to somebody which also impossible due to the fact that these tickets are tighter up to personal ID and credit card used for purchase. Finally, I was offered $30 for not complaining, which I refused."
"I got an email with a discount. It didn’t work so I called and chatted and I was assured the discount function was just not working at the time and I would be reimbursed after I purchased and emailed customer service. So I had done my best to validate pricing upfront. After purchase I emailed multiple times, chatted multiple times, and disputed the charge... still no discount! Never use Vivid Seats! Spread the word!"
"Online purchase of two VIP seats for concert in CA. CC processed for $700.00. No worries, as long as I get tickets. Has to be app download for tickets. One week later no tickets. One week later, multiple calls to Vivid CC group. No case remarks, no dedicated CSR, call center. Identify problem and multiple efforts to download tickets to me. Told, ""We are not seller"" and ""Sorry but we cannot refund you, our policy."" I stated, ""No deliverable of service or tickets, how can you justify keeping money."" Told, ""Sorry, seller is liable, not us."" Really? You received payment not the seller. I am out tickets which was most important and 700.00. Bought insurance and told unless you're sick or issue with travel we cannot refund. Another SCAM. 42.00. Very sad. I would think after identifying problem they would dedicate a case worker and resolve. Nope. 20 minute holds, multiple people and restate details of case each time. BEWARE!"
"I purchased tickets to KoRn and Alice In Chains at the Pepsi Center in Denver, Colorado. My purchase email said that my tickets would be delivered as Flash Seats (the only thing that the Pepsi Center accepts)... They weren't. Instead, they sent them via their own Vivid Seats app, 4 days before the event. I am currently on the phone with someone in Indonesia most likely trying to get my seats transferred to Flash Seats or get my money back. I am not hopeful of either. I will most likely end up having to hire a lawyer to get my money back. Do yourself a favor and run as fast and far as you can from these people. They are absolute cons!!!!"
Another company that refuses to answer the phone... They list several numbers... NONE OF THEM ALLOW YOU TO TALK TO A REAL PERSON. If I have any problems with my VERY expensive purchase I will start an online boycott. They are what is wrong with this country.
"I had never been to Fenway Park before, but have been to older stadiums and, thus knew to look for tickets without obstructed views. Purchased tickets based on the Vivid Seats' seat view, which showed no obstruction. Got to our seats and they were directly behind a grandstand pole...buyer beware that Vivid Seats does not verify the accuracy of the ticket descriptions. Or at least not their seat view map."
"Slick ads offering promotions $10 or %10 off but buyer beware! There is a service fee that you do not see until allegedly at checkout (I did not see it although I was assured I agreed to it) and you don't see the fee in your order details either or how it is calculated. In other words you must catch the notice of fee somewhere right before checkout or forever be kept guessing what the fee is for. SNEAKY, no other word for it. Should be illegal."
"Bought concert tickets (the hidden fees are absolutely staggering), they advertise that you can resell your tickets but this is false advertisement. You cannot resell tickets as a small time individual. You cannot physically hold your paid merchandise. You have to wait until 24 hours before the event (after paying absurd amounts). You don't know 100% even if your seats are right next to each other. They say they push events that are within 24 hours to top priority, if you have any problems. I waited on hold for forty five minutes while simultaneously waiting to ""live chat"". I never spoke or chatted to a single person. Stay clear of this company, they are scam artists. Our government NEEDS to regulate this kind of illegal activity."
"I believe the seller had no intention of sending ticket link--Vivid Seats is guilty of Fraud! Buyer beware as to easy to get ripped off and never receive the tickets you purchased. No help from Vivid Seats to recover, resend or even assist in making it right. Slimeballs."
"Bought tickets for the Saints game for my birthday, tickets would not download. Tried several phones to make sure it wasn't an issue with the device. Waited outside the stadium for 2 hours on the phone with several people being transferred from one department to the next dept. Also live chatted with a rep, no one was any help. Needless to say we missed the game and they had the nerves to tell us that our issue would have to be investigated before a refund could be issued which would take at least 3-5 business days. That's pure bs. "
"You hear people write reviews all the time and say, ""I don't normally do this""... I am not one to try to talk negative about businesses because great companies can have a bad day. This was my first and last experience with this company... Have people coming in from three states and I purchased 5 tickets for over $550. They were purchased in an upper level called the Stretch. Two days before the even I got a call and said they cant make the tickets stick but they can take $10 off and got to a comparable area. In my defense it was during a huge storm and I had a client in front of me. They say I verbally agreed to this and that is now final; however, once I received the tickets in writing and downloaded them I saw they were in the Grandstand and called advising the Stretch and the Grandstand are not the same. "
"If I could give this crap-hole of a site and the people behind it negative stars, I would. Completely rude, incapable, incompetent, rude, 100% rip off artists. Even tried to have me take a screenshot of Ticketmaster Tickets so they could change them into .PDFs which is COMPLETELY illegal now. In long run, I'm out over $1,000 and the jerk I talked to on the phone...Eric or Erin or Satan, was a complete jackhole. What comes around goes around. STAY FAR, FAR, FAR, FAR, AWAY. Buy your tickets on legit sites and not threw a bunch of pompous money hungry brokers. UNREAL. Worse experience with a company ever. If I lived closer to them, I'd slap their Mommas in the face for raising such **."
"TLDR: Everyone at Vivid Seats is a shark who wants to make a sale. They don't want to help you in any way, their promotions don't work on purpose so that you will have to call and order tickets through a sales rep. They want to sell you tickets that don't even exist so that you can wait until the day of the event to get an email saying that you won't be receiving your tickets. This may seem silly considering they would have to refund you. However, I was informed by the first sales rep I spoke to who kept telling me ""This company is legit and this seller has sold with us before. They're a professional..."" that if a seller fails to provide tickets Vivid Seats fines them. So, the sales team at Vivid Seats only cares about making the sale because even if you don't get your tickets they get money from fining the seller."
We lost our physical ticket due to moving and they would not reissue another. We purchased the insurance which was suppose to cover the loss and it did not. Do not purchase the insurance. It is a waste of money.
"At a concert, was announced a special time frame to purchase tickets, limited time special for next concert, so hurriedly purchased only to find I picked the wrong deal. Purchased the correct one and tried to cancel the other purchase, rep said, ""no."" Asked for tickets so I can sell them, they said, ""no."" Concert is 6 MONTHS away, won't refund me. Subpar service. Use StubHub. Might cost bit more but they care about their customers. These clowns don't."
First I would like to say I have been a customer for years and I am absolutely shocked at how they handled this. I purchased 4 tickets for a game and spent the better half of 10 hours trying to accept the tickets via the link they sent. I spoke to 5 different representatives and was instructed to do 5 different things. I was unable to download the tickets and forced to buy 4 more tickets. They will NOT offer a credit or refund the amount which makes no sense since the problem was with the link they sent. They offered nothing which for a company this size is pathetic.
"I purchased some tickets to a local concert through FanXChange on Home Depot's Perks at Work website. I paid a total of $87.21 for the tickets. I realized right after I purchased them that I had the date wrong and would not be able to attend. I called FanXChange literally two minutes after the purchase, and they refused to cancel the charges. I asked to speak to a supervisor and have yet to hear back. I went to the venue's website shortly after - only to find I could have purchased the SAME tickets there for $28!!! This is a completely unethical business, and The Home Depot should drop them like a hot coal."
"If you're even remotely thinking about purchasing something from Vivid Seats, READ THE SMALL PRINT! I originally thought I bought two ticket to a Cubs game for a Father's Day Gift. When I read the small print with my order confirmation, I learned it was actually a supplemental package (entrance to the Stadium Club) to be purchased with a ticket. The total was over $150 just for this."
"I purchased tickets to the Miami vs Florida game in Orlando 4 months ago. I live in Minnesota, I'm traveling to Orlando a few days before the game. I check Vivid app, it says tickets will be delivered the day of the game! I call Vivid. They tell me they might arrive earlier. Ashley ** in customer service was 0 help at all. She kept repeating the same sentence over and over like a robot. She told me to change the address to my hotel. On the day of the game I wont be in the hotel. You buy tickets months early and Vivid sends the tickets via ups or mail a couple days before the event. Don't use Vivid!!"
"Purchased tickets thru Vivid Seats for Rolling Stones event tomorrow and additionally paid Vivid for parking pass. We were emailed the tickets for the concert quite some time ago. We have not received our paid for parking pass. Now we have event tickets and nowhere to park, which makes the event tickets useless. We were told we would receive the parking ticket by yesterday, we didn't. Then Vivid changed that again & we were told we would receive it by 1:00 a.m, last night, we didn't. Now Vivid has changed it again and we are being told we 'SHOULD' receive it within 2 hours of event!!! This will be useless to us as we are traveling and do not even know if we should bother, we could arrive and still no parking ticket. Buyer beware, it is up to the seller to email my parking pass and the seller has not done so!!!!"
5mo ago my husband bought 4 Florida Georgia Line PIT tickets from Vivid Seats. We spent 1623.00. Went to the concert last night and the tickets did not scan . Now we have the headache of trying to get reimbursed. Never mind the $93 on Uber ride and $60 in babysitting that we are now out. Never again.
"My brother was operated at Dana Farber in Boston so I had to sell seats to the clubhouse for the weekend since I was unable to spent the weekend at Saratoga. I posted my four tickets each day for three days on July 26, 27 & 28 on Vivid Seats and Stub Hub. On Vivid Seats I sold two tickets in the clubhouse for Saturday, July 27th. They sent me a printed label for the individual that bought the tickets totaling more than $85. I immediately went to UPS and mailed the tickets on July 16th. I have called several times, did the chat room online, wrote emails, etc. with NO response asking where is my money for the tickets! Every time they indicate comments like ""information doesn't match"" or email incorrect! DO NOT SELL YOUR TICKETS ON VIVID SEATS. I'm still trying to get my money, what a scam! Sold tickets on Stub Hub and they did exactly as expected. Wish I could give them 0 stars!!"
"I received an email from Vivid Seats stating that if I used them for one purchase, I would get a 20% discount on tickets to a second event. Nowhere in the email does it give any minimal time required in between purchases. I was unable to use the 20% discount on a second event I tried to purchase 2 days after the first, and was told that it took on the order of 10 days to receive the code after the first purchase. That would be after the second event occurs. I wouldn't have purchased the first ticket if I knew of this catch, because Stubhub had slightly lower fees for the same event."
I bought Dave Matthews Band tickets just hours before the show. I was having trouble downloading. It turned out to be on my end. I called customer service and she was very patient and helpful. She was able to send the tickets to my wife’s phone just in time for us to see the entire show!! Thanks for your help!!
I ordered tickets for an upcoming college football game in Nov. After the order was placed they informed me the tickets would be sent out the week of the game (which is in another state) via post office. No guarantee the tickets would arrive early enough for us to travel to the state and receive the tickets before we are to leave. My issue was the game is in November but they won't send the tickets until the Monday of the game week via regular mail. I wanted to cancel and they told me no way. Don't use this company!
Went on Vivid to order tickets for Saratoga Race Track. Tickets offering map showed Box Seats by finish line flashing. Clicked on location ordered 2 box seat tickets in row one. Completed transactions. Received tickets and they were located as Bar Seats row 1 Seats 24 and 25. In the stretch location opposite end of track. Contacted customer service 3 times and they tell me that’s what the tickets were. No and I still see those tickets being offered the same way a month later. Something fishy here. Will never buy from them again.
"They charge an exorbitant amount for their service. There are many other cheaper places to get tickets. Not sure why they charge so much. I should have looked at their fee, but I was happy to get these tickets for my mom's birthday and overlooked it. Tickets weren't even that expensive but they made it so. Turned $150 worth of tickets to $300. I will never use their service again."
They overcharge me by hundreds of dollars!!!! Sent me multiple tickets. When I asked why they said it was a mistake and gave me the worst available tickets they had!!!! Every time giving me worse tickets for my anniversary.
"On July 20, 2019, I purchased two Indianapolis Colts Season Tickets. I found an incredible, once in a lifetime deal on Vivid Seats website. It was club level seating for $350ish a ticket. I immediately purchased. Later that day, I received a text message requesting that I call back customer service. I did. They advised me that the seller was unable to fulfill the order and that the order would be cancelled. The rep advised that the tickets were likely sold on another website and are now unavailable. The tickets were not already sold, the seller clearly made a mistake on the pricing and now did not want to sell the tickets for the price that they listed. Vivid Seats website clearly states that seller is responsible for any and all pricing errors. However, they did not hold this seller accountable. I've used Vivid before and it was pretty painless however this transaction has ruined any future business from me. DO NOT USE VIVID SEATS."
"Purchased tickets that were non existent, after spending 50 on long distance call from Canada, they offered me to buy a different ticket on the game that was already half way in. Absolutely no interest in customer satisfaction from Jazzman, customer manager."
"This service is terrible! They change the dates of when you will receive the tickets and then will not stand behind their ""guarantee"". They have no concern if you never receive the tickets - this may be a complete scam! DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!"
"Bought 5 tickets as a group to Miss Saigon for my mom's bday. Tickets said rows were to be determined. But ALL FIVE SEATS were separated. Could have easily bought smaller groups of 2/3, but instead it ruined the entire experience. Customer service straight up doesn’t give a **! Rude and unhelpful. Website was very ambiguous, then customer service makes it seem like you agreed to it. Gross way of doing business."
My daughter purchased tickets which we thought were for $323 for both tickets as this person isn’t well known. We were also charged a service fee of over $280.00. How do they get away with this $960.00 for two tickets. This is just wrong.
You must not make a mistake. My elderly mother was trying to get concert tickets in Las Vegas but when transaction went thru it was for one in California. Just want to change tickets for correct location. Customer Service will not help her in any way!
"I bought a Floozies ticket on their site and it was $25 more than Etix for the same ticket. This site should be a last resort, please don't waste your money on this website. I hate companies that are predatory like this one. We all just want to go see our favorite musicians, not get stolen from. SO DISAPPOINTED!!!! That's a boycott from me!"
Bought Rolling Stones tickets for 7/14 in May. Understood that the tickets would be provided electronic by 7/13. Concert was postponed one day to 7/15 and got an email stating the tickets would be sent on or before 7/14. Contacted Vivid Seats help and was told I would need a computer to receive the tickets. Logged onto a chat with Vivid Seats and was told the tickets would be sent the morning of 7/15. I told him that was unacceptable but his response was “if you don’t receive the tickets before the event Vivid Seats will refund your money. I asked why the electronic tickets were not available and the response was that I will receive them before the event.
I bought tickets at 99$ per seat for the concert. I picked field level seats at a higher price. Instead of the tickets I paid for I received tickets valued at 49.50 each.  After hours on video chat I was told the fine print doesn’t guarantee the exact seat but it’s comparable. My seats couldn’t be further from field level unless they were in a different stadium.
"I purchased tickets for a Florida Georgia Line concert on 7/11 through Vivid Seats. When I arrived at the concert, I was told by security that the concert was to be rescheduled due to the down pouring weather. I drove an hour home, woke up the next morning to find out that the concert did indeed happen! Three hours late! Vivid Seats won't give me a refund at all. My ticket wasn't even scanned or used. $100 down the drain, all because of miscommunication. So disappointed. My friends used StubHub and got refunds/credits to their accounts. USE STUBHUB."
"Like other ticket broker services, you expect to pay more than face value for tickets purchased from Vivid Seats. You accept it. But when you give them your money, you expect to actually receive the tickets you are paying for. In our case, this did not happen. Including the Vivid Seats fees, we paid $250 for tickets to see a show at a casino in Atlantic City. We received the email that said the tickets were transferred to us, and accepted the transfer by clicking the link. This is where the trouble began. The tickets never showed up. Vivid Seats support just says ""well, you accepted the transfer, so we can't punish the seller"". I wasn't asking them to punish the seller. I just wanted the tickets."
"I purchased tickets for an upcoming concert and had bad experience with the purchase and the allotment with the seating which was not available at the time of purchase. When I called customer service they have helpless and not even considerate, advised to see the tickets on some other website that can be found on google. They would not consider exchange. Very bad experience and would not recommend."
"I bought a ticket off their website (on which the fee was 50+% of the asking price), and then needed to turn around and sell it as I couldn't go anymore. I went to sell it on the same platform and was informed that I couldn't sell it because it was a mobile ticket only. When I was connected to support they told me to google ""sell tickets"" and that I could probably figure out how to sell it somewhere else. Disgusting, predatory company. I don't know how anyone in good conscience could work there."
"Bought 5 tickets to a concert ($75) each as shown on the site, great. Check-out price should have been $375. They show that price, and then in a SMALL click-through box (which I didn't even see), they show another price of $480. Why? They charge $100 service fee for NOTHING. I clicked through and did not see the fee (my fault -- but why hide it behind a small pop-up box). I immediately realize my error, customer service says nothing can be done. No help or nothing. The website seems VERY scammy. The fact that pricing is NOT up-front makes it feel like a cheap airline or car company. If you're going to charge service fees, fine, but DON'T put it in a pop-box box or underneath boxes which are never seen."
"Accidentally listed mobile tickets as PDF for Rolling Stones concert I could no longer attend. Tickets sold same night that Stones postponed tour. Spent 2 days unable to reach VS to see what to do, as it seemed wrong to continue if the whole concert was now questionable. Strongly worded emails & answers in ""help"" made me accept sale even with issues that would buyer even want these due to indefinite postponement, plus I'd likely be able to attend delayed concert. Finally reached someone early the next week, was assured nothing would happen til concert was rescheduled but when we realized ticket delivery situation she would reach out to buyer to see if they'd accept other delivery method, if not she was to offer that I'd pay to get hard tickets mailed from Ticketmaster. "
"This company has the nerve to place guarantee for the their customers. Let me tell you this is very untrue. I will never do business with them again. I would not recommend anyone do business with them. Now that I have gotten right to the point here is my story. I purchased tickets on February 14, 2019 for a concert taking place on August 31, 2019. That is 6 months after purchase. My tickets were lost. This company will not replace them. They have stolen over $400 dollars from me. That is how I see it. I paid $400 dollars for something that I will not get. That is stealing. I warn you BE AWARE do not purchase from this company."
"This was my first and last time buying from Vivid Seats. They blamed us for issues with shipping and refused to refund us our money after they were unable to reissue our tickets when we were promised it would be taken care of. The supervisor we were handed off to was incredibly rude and flat out told my fiancee that the only reason we received even a partial credit to my account was so I wouldn't write a bad review. Maybe not illegal, but incredibly poor business practice."
"To whom it may concern: My name is ** and I purchased three Rolling Stones tickets on July 4, 2019. After receiving a confirmation email, I was emailed a cancellation notification. After speaking with a Vivid representative, it was revealed, that somebody at your office processed an unauthorized cancellation from someone other than myself. I did not receive in my email or by phone, any contact concerning this cancellation request. I did not authorize this request! Nobody confirmed it by email or phone - they just processed it. Wouldn’t you need to verify someone’s identity before cancellation? "
"I ordered 4 tickets to ""Bring It! LIVE"" with were $69 each, therefore my total should have been $276 but instead it was $356... I called to see what all the additional charges were and they said they charge $70 extra to just order from their website then a $10 delivery fee (even though I am receiving the tickets through e-mail). I will never order from them again. And on top of that their customer service is terrible."
"I purchased tickets to a baseball game from Vivid Seats. Naturally, the game was cancelled 10 minutes after my purchase. I contact them for a refund as their policy states: ""We are only able to issue refunds for events that are officially cancelled by the venue, team, or performer and not rescheduled"". Vivid Seats would not abide by their policy as they say that the game ""will be"" rescheduled (though it hadn't yet so it isn't rescheduled)."
"Purchased seats 5 months in advance, week before musical was told seats were not available. Substitute tickets were in a different zone and far less desirable. Paid $900 per ticket, was sent $177 tickets, refund $193 per ticket. 2 of the seats were so far right, viewers could not see part of performance. Their agreement states they guarantee tickets in the zone if a substitution is made. NOT TRUE."
"When I purchased tickets from they sent me to another ticket company who had the incorrect delivery method. Spent 3 hours trying to talk to a real person on the phone, but it only loops you back to prerecorded messages. I tried live chat after having to provide an annoying amount of info to even talk to someone on the chat. They were unable to help me and told me to go to the other company. Their help was essentially useless and complete waste of my three hours. Then I went to the other company, who said they were unable to help because I had not bought the tickets from them. A week away from concert and still no idea how I will receive my tickets: absolutely ridiculous. DO NOT USE VIVID SEATS."
If I could put 0 stars I would. My event was postponed to a date when I am out of state for and they refused to refund my money. Lame excuse they are the middle man. You sold me the tickets - you are responsible. I will never use this company again. They have a no refund no exchange policy. But really in this case I was made to pay for however changed the event. They really suck.
"I ordered 2 tickets in January for a game on Saturday, June 29th. The delivery states they will be delivered June 28th. I purchased additional tickets to the same event in the same section from another site and received those over 2 months ago. It is now June 26 and I need to sell these tickets and can't because I still do not have them. I will NEVER EVER purchase from Vivid Seats again."
"Very expensive tickets, they are re-sellers. I have ordered almost two months in advance, one day before sending me the electronic tickets, I got a call from them notifying me that the seller does not have the seats I have purchased. They offered me a different seats. I took them, since I realize I didn’t have a much choice. Not good experience dealing with them..Will not buy ever tickets through Vivid Seats again..."
"I tried buying tickets through Vivid Seats, I paid for them with my credit card but I accidentally declined the tickets. I assumed that my payment did not go through but I later discovered that I had been charged and was unable to get a refund. Buyer beware- Vivid Seats will be charge your credit card even if you are unable to have the tickets transferred to you."
"I ordered tickets on Vivid Seats for Young Frankenstein at the Belk Blumenthal Theatre, located at 130 North Tryon Street in Charlotte. This is a very nice Theatre, and only hosts top level professional events. I paid a total of $136.11 for two tickets. I received 2 tickets for Young Frankenstein at a Community College venue, Theatre Charlotte, located at 501 Queens Road. These tickets have a face value of $17.00. I realize that with resale outlets often the tickets may cost more than face value. However, I believe the ticket sellers and/or Vivid Seats was intentionally deceptive in advertising this production at a professional venue. No one would pay $136.11 for a student community college production."
"I bought two seats to see Blink 182 at the Austin 360 Ampitheater for the 2019 summer tour. I double checked the venue and information before confirming. When I received my confirmation email, it showed the venue in Houston. I called immediately and spoke with a senior customer service person who told me there was no way their computer could make that mistake and they allowed no refunds or exchanges. "
"I placed an order on 6/4 for 6 tickets to the Cubs game on 6/8 in Terrace 217 Row: 6. I specifically picked these seats for the view of the Jumbo Screen. It was my sis-in-law's anniversary. So I paid $150 to post on the board during the game. I received an email stating that the seller transferred the tickets and to follow the specific steps to retrieve them. After numerous attempts I followed instructions on the MLB website to contact them by phone. So I called MLB and they couldn't find any tickets transferred into my account. They then had me speak with a Cubs CS rep who also said the same thing. I tried to reach VIVID but because I was still so many days before the event, I could get a hold of anyone."
"We went on Vivid Seats to purchase tickets to a Washington Nationals game. We clicked on a game for 6/20. However, when we received the tickets, they were for a game on 6/18, which happened to start about 2 hours after I purchased the tickets. Upon calling Vivid Seats they refused to be of any assistance. Claiming even if it was a misdirection, they do not provide exchanges, refunds or any sort of an effort to help their customers. Worst customer service and terrible company altogether. Our company will never be using this site again."
"I bought my first pair of tickets from Vivid Seats because that particular game was cheaper than on StubHub. I then received an email from Vivid Seats stating that if I made one additional purchase within 30 days, I would receive 20% off a subsequent purchase. I used the link in that email to make two additional purchases. However, I never received my 20% code/link/coupon from Vivid Seats. When I contact customer service, I get told to forward the email that was initially sent to me for them ""to look into it."" Total sham... classic bait-&-switch."
We purchased tickets to the New York Yankees baseball game and we never received the tickets. Vivid Seats refused to send the tickets or refund us. I filed a complaint with the BBB. Beware of this company!
"I purchased tickets to a AAA baseball game more than a month before the event. It was a popular date and not too many tickets were available. The listing read ""TBD Section Seats"" and it was over $100 for two tickets. It said we would find out what section the ""seats"" were in before the event. In the meantime I found out my daughter-in-law had two tickets for us, so I told her to give them to friends since we already had some. "
"Today, I had my first experience with Vivid Seats. I was on the phone with Brian and I have never been more happy with a customer service agent. He was so patient with me, explained how everything worked. He gave me his extension in case I have any more questions as time went on. If you want to talk to someone who is amazing at their job and will take the time to help you in any way possible. Ask to speak with Brian!!"
"I have never experienced worse customer service in my life, including the notorious internet/tv provider companies. They sell tickets for OVER DOUBLE face value cost and while there are still tickets available on the original site. I blame my own stupidity and hastiness for clicking the first site to come up and using them instead of others but am posting this in hopes no one else will. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS."
"Scam company. I ordered 2 tickets to Yes at PNC from them. After at least 8 calls with customer service, I finally realized that all 8 voices answer the questions the same exact way. They took my $228 and never delivered the tickets. Well run scam but I hope this company gets what they deserve."
"I bought seats that should have been together. When I finally received the tickets, they were not. Vivid Seats was not helpful. Tickets did not have my name. Not sure how they operate legally. Scalpers is the best thing you could call them."
Purchased concert tickets and a month later they had the same tickets for sale for 1/5th of the price I paid. This was NOT a high demand concert and when I contacted them they were full of **. Such a scam to overcharge people. I don't care how they are selling them. They should NOT gouge people on pricing. Will NEVER use them or recommend them to anyone.
"If I could give less than a 1 star I would. My family purchased 10 tickets to see Paul McCartney on his Freshen Up Tour. Over $3000 total spent. 24 hours before the concert, they called and said they did not have our tickets. They stated “they have been sold to a third party, it was out of their hands and they could not fulfill our order.” Whatever that means!!?? I will be sure to never purchase or let anyone I know purchase from Vivid Seats again."
"I purchased tickets already for pit tickets for Charlotte, NC for Ariana Grande. However, I decided last night to go to the Atlanta, GA part of the tour too. I was panicking for last minute tickets and had my doubts about using Vivid Seats based on other reviews. I decided to give it a shot since there was an amazing deal on tickets for about a few rows back. Based on other reviews, I was scared that my tickets would not scan... The tickets scanned and the experience was flawless. Thank you so much. One of the best sites I have used. Also, customer service was really good at helping me with any promotions that were ongoing for ticket sales."
"On May 2, I thought I purchased 2 tickets from Vivid Seats on for a game to be played on an June 19. I paid using PayPal. My credit card was charged $142.50. I never received the tickets I tried using both PayPal and Vivid to resolve the problem. PayPal said they received proof that the tickets were sent and received. I'm not sure what type of proof that have. In checking My user ID on Vivid Seats' own website. it shows NO history of purchasing any tickets during that time period in question. Yet I was still charged. Any correspondence with Vivid Seats has fallen on deaf ears. Vivid proclaims that they have a 100 percent customer satisfaction policy ""Peace of Mind"". This is about as honest as their Live Chat, which I found not to be Live, just programmed to reply to set questions. Dealing with Vivid and even PayPal has been very frustrating and upsetting. I will avoid using Vivid Seats in the future. They are NOT customer friendly."
I spent $2849.10 on tickets for the Blues vs Bruins game 6 purchased on May 22 and today is June 8. I still don't have my tickets. I have called 3 times and live chatted twice. I have never spent this much on tickets in my life and really looking forward to the game but still don't know if I have tickets. They have given all kinds of reason of why they aren't available such as the price of the ticket and the event hasn't released the ticket. I even bought insurance. One of their customer service representatives told me that they have up until 2 hours before to give you your tickets. Imagine not knowing if you have tickets up until right before the event. Horrible site. Never ever use them. BUYER BEWARE.
"The spoke with a customer service person in regards to ticket sales about three weeks ago, I was quoted a price on the phone but to my amazement was charged more than quoted. I called back the girl back and she said ""we shall credit some back!"" But guess what. The credit never came. This business conducts deceptive business practices by not being truthful plus lying. I emailed customer service back about the problem! But guess what again more lies and BS. Beware about these rip off artists."
"I bought 5 tickets to Greta Van Fleet @ Jacobs Pavilion in Cleveland, OH on 6/2/19. I paid $250 for each ticket + $75 convenience fee for each ($325 x 5 = 1,625.) I thought I was getting front row for the price. When I printed off the tickets, I was told it doesn't matter if the name and seat number don't match what you just purchased. When I got to the venue, we were told we had general admission seats and should have only paid $44.50 each. I should have checked the reviews before purchasing, because it looks like this kind of thing happens all the time. Expensive lesson learned!"
"Updated on 10/25/2019: In the first go round with a dispute at my bank of this charge, Vivid Seats sent the bank the page that said ""ALL SALES FINAL, NO REFUNDS!"". And believe it or not, my bank, after I forwarded to them by Certified Mail, all the DOCUMENTS that showed the tickets I had bought were CANCELED, that Vivid Seats said ""We will try to get the Seller to forward you the tickets, but can't more or less ""promise"" they will!"", my email stating I CANCELED the tickets because they were never received, a copy of my purchase of tickets to this concert to replace the ones not received, and on and on and on - I couldn't believe it, but the BANK went with Vivid Seats and ruled against me! It was like the Bank didn't EVEN BOTHER TO READ WHAT I FORWARDED TO THEM AT THEIR REQUEST! I'm not done with them either!"
"I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Purchased tickets for my daughter and her friend in August of 2018 for the concert in Buffalo on 6/1/2019. With Vivid Seats you do not get your tickets right away. They are a 2nd or 3rd party seller apparently. All this I now know all too well. Because I had not received the actual tickets and the concert was a few days away. I reached out to Vivid Seats asking when they would be delivered. I received an email stating, ""The seller has indicated that these tickets will be available by: 5/30/2019."" I am at a conference on the west coast and my child is on the east coast so I need time to create an account to get the mobile ticket and transfer this to her. The ticket is tied to your email used to buy the ticket and you have to create an account with the original seller, (which you are not told who that is). "
"This was the biggest ripoff I have experienced from an app. I purchased tickets which were cancelled with no clarification or a reason why. Tried to contact customer service which was a prime example of a frustrating cycle of dead ends. Sales representatives were great but could not fix the problem the app created. I purchased tickets again for worse seats and double the price hours after they cancelled my original order. Service fee per ticket was $50, incredibly overpriced for horrible service."
"I was trying to buy tickets for a game two weeks from now for my wife's birthday and when I clicked on ""continue"" it switched them to today's game. I didn't notice until I clicked on submit. I called them within 2 minutes and they said ""sorry the money's been sent but they would give me a 30 dollar gift card for future purchases"". What? You just took $182 from me 5 minutes ago and because there is an error with your website you're offering me 30 back? When I said I feel like calling the BBB or writing a bad review the representative said, ""If you intend to do that then no $30 coupon!"" I will never buy tickets from this site again. Very disappointed."
"I will never buy from Vivid Seats again! I was sent a promotion from them and fulfilled the requirements of said promotion down to the fine print only for them to try and shaft me. I spent 3 hours on the phone with them, 7 different agents only to be told that they would give me the courtesy and apply the promotion. They also asked me to not contact the Better Business Bureau. Garbage policy, garbage customer service, I’d suggest taking your business elsewhere."
"I purchased 2 tickets to The Rolling Stones for 5/7/19 and the concert was canceled due to Mick’s surgery. It was rescheduled for 6/29 which falls in the middle of a planned vacation. I contacted Vivid and inquired about what they could do to help me sell the tickets. They said they could do nothing because they are E-tickets and they do not resell them. So I purchased tickets thru them, paid them a processing fee and was told that I would need to figure out a way to sell them myself. I never will do business with Vivid Seats again."
I ordered tickets for a concert that was cancelled due to weather. It was on Saturday May 18th. They rescheduled it for Sunday May 19th. I was not able to attend that day. I purchased insurance on tickets for this reason. I was told by Vivid Seats to contact insurance company. Insurance company told me I could not get a refund because the concert was rescheduled. Doesn't matter if I was able to attend on the rescheduled date. (I live 3 hours from the venue.) Vivid seats is definitely worse company I've ever done business with! They were not willing to do anything. Several friends bought tickets from other companies and was fully refunded.
"This is the first review I ever left but I don't want this to happen to someone else. After completing my purchase I noticed my old address was associated with my account so I immediately called to have shipping address changed but they were closed so I sent to emails explaining they had the wrong address and followed up with a call when they opened. They told me it would be taken care of and sent me an email with correct shipping address, however still sent tickets to previous address. After a month of back and forth they told me there's nothing they can do and wouldn't refund my money. I did everything I could do to fix the error immediately and because someone on their end dropped the ball I'm screwed. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
"I was scammed by Vivid Seats. I ordered two seats to the Ferryman, and paid them $331.07 for two limited view seats with a list price of $89 each. I realized later that I could have ordered the seats directly from the theatre, and would have gotten much better seats at a fair price. Never again!!"
"I purchase five tickets from Vivid Seats for a concert in Boston. A few days later I received an email that the concert had been postponed until further notice. I Googled the star and read an article that the singer had actually canceled the concert - not postponed it - due to throat surgery. When I contacted the customer service she told me that I couldn't get my money back because the concert was postponed and not canceled. When I told her that the online newspaper were quoting the star himself canceling the concert, she told me it didn't matter."
Awful. They sold me a ticket and the night before the show told me the ticket did not exist. Did not even try to fix the issue and no way to file a complaint. I will never use them again. Terrible customer service as well - rude and unhelpful.
"My review is about vivid seats customer service and tickets. I have been in touch with customer service who originally helped me purchase tickets. So I will say their customer service is fair. I purchased tickets for a concert and wanted to back out because I found better seats for cheaper on another site. Also the reviews made me feel like I threw $250 out the window.. But I must say, Vivid Seats itself may not be a scam. I requested a refund through PayPal and although PayPal denied the refund, Vivid seats actually personally refunded me. I ended up happy with better seats and honestly that was very kind of the company since they have a no refund policy. Anyways, I think it depends on the seller of your particular ticket. I would recommend you purchase MOBILE TICKETS because then you have more wiggle room before an event to tell if they’re fakes or not."
"I Googled Hollywood Bowl to buy some tickets. Didn't notice that the first hit was a re-seller. Bought two tickets at $202 each for a concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Discovered when I printed the tickets out that their face value is $50 each. I asked Vivid Seats why they charged so much more, and they said ""service charge"" (this in addition to the $125 service charge they actually copped to). Hollywood Bowl says it can't guarantee that I actually purchased seats for the concert. Vivid Seats won't refund. Don't be a sucker (like me)! This company cannot be trusted. They should be shut down. DO NOT USE VIVID SEATS!!!"
I purchased tickets to Diamondbacks Rockies game. Received an email with link to accept the tickets. This yielded an error report. Contacted customer service Chat. After 2 hours trying to resolve still had no tickets. After accepting the tickets I would have had to set up an account with MLB Ballpark and download the app to access the tickets. Meanwhile the game had started an hour ago.
"When I received my confirmation for a ticket purchase the date was wrong. I immediately called them and asked to get tickets for the proper date. They said, ""Too bad you bought them, we won't cancel your order and will deliver tickets in a week."" I told them I wasn't even in Las Vegas on that date and that I couldn't use the tickets. I told them I was willing to purchase tickets for the proper date from them and did so within a couple of hours. Also, when I tried to talk with them about the dispute, they hung up on me. I think that they were both rude and totally unreasonable. Buy your tickets elsewhere."
I am new to Vivid Seats. Order concert tickets 5/5/19. Got my tickets right away. Super easy to print out. Looked at my bank account statement and got charged an insurance fee of 15.50. When in my total no insurance fee was included.
"Horrible, I was robbed $518.22. I purchase 3 ticket for $205.21 with all taxes included. I put my credit card info and then I received a bill for $518.22 with the ticket confirmation. I call back and spoke to represent name Asad. He explain that is nothing to do that they charge a numbers of fees and this is an action company. But they never disclaim that. Never purchase anything for this website."
"I purchased two tickets to Phil Collins in Vegas MGM for 10/27/18. First clue of an issue is they don't send the tickets to you. I arranged for Vivid to deliver to our Vegas hotel. Tickets never did show up at all. I did get a prompt online the night before and was able to print them. Went to concert. Got in the building. The seats sold by Vivid ($1,350 for two tickets) did not exist. Called AMEX and they charged back the ticket amount. Vivid charged back again with a copy of their NO 100% refund. I had to prove to AMEX by sending a detailed seating chart of the MGM that the seats did not exist. Vivid was not only not helpful; they were confrontational and unprofessional. And worse... Didn't care at all. I would never do business with Vivid Seats... They are frauds."
"I purchased two seats for a Spring training game in Ft. Myers, FL in February 2019. The purchase was made several weeks before the game. My attempts to reach them when my tickets had not yet arrived one week before the game were handled by e-mail since it was impossible to reach what they called customer service on the phone."
"I purchased tickets for section 302 pavilion seats to Greta Van Fleet, picked them out of the list available, which were much more expensive than the lawn. When the confirmation came through, the tickets were for gen admission. I inquired how they are allowed to lie to customers about the seats purchased. I was told it’s not their problem, but they’d be happy to set me up an account to resell these tickets on their site. I’m disgusted by the fraud this site is seemingly allowed to commit with no penalty. Concerts are supposed to be a happy, joyful opportunity to spend time with other music lovers, and vividseats.com just ** all over that."
I purchased two tickets to the Yankees and Diamondbacks game tomorrow. Only after they overcharged me did they tell me that the tickets wouldn't be delivered until the 29th. The 29th is today and it has taken me over two hours to finally contact someone there because I have yet to receive the tickets. They tell me that they don't have them then they will send them when they get them. So they are essentially selling tickets with a huge service fee yet they don't get possessed the tickets they are selling. This has to be illegal. Clearly it is deceptive and dishonest and leaves this customer wondering if I have tickets to the event tomorrow or not.
"What should have been a relaxing day at the ballpark turned out to be an unbelievably stressful experience. After numerous calls and online support, spending 2 hours attempting to access this so-called ticket - somewhere in cyberspace, assistance at the Wrigley box office to no avail, downloaded apps, etc. I ended up purchasing another ticket directly at the Wrigley box office less over $10 dollars in fees, preferred location, etc. The ticket agent advised it was never transferred. I even called again from inside the ballpark to see if the other ticket and seat was accessible which it wasn't."
My husband wanted to surprise me with Il Divo tickets and accidentally clicked on YG (rap). It was right below Il Divo and he never heard of YG so he thought it was the seats/rows. After he clicked the confirmations did not show Il Divo and he realized immediately he made a mistake. Within seconds called Vivid Seats and they told him all tickets are non-refundable. We still wanted the Il Divo seats and went with Ticketmaster. Out 400.00 because they would not work with us. POOR POOR Customer Service and for that we will NEVER buy from VIVID SEATS again!!!
I purchased two tickets for Garth Brooks in Gainesville five months before the concert. After I purchased tickets I went online and read reviews and instantly felt sick to my stomach. So many stories with bad outcomes. However my experience was completely different. My ticket were mailed to me earlier than expected. I was told they would be delivered a few days before the concert. I actually received them 2 weeks after I bought them. For the next few months I worried that my tickets were fake and that they wouldn’t scan at the gate. But I had zero issue. Great concert!
"I listed 2 tickets for sale which I have physically in hand as well as a PDF version. The tickets were sold in 2 transactions on 2 separate days. The first sale I confirmed and attempted to provide the ticket via PDF upload to Vivid Seats' site. The upload failed multiple times so I called customer service wondering why. They told me that the specific venue for the concert is ""Flash Seats transfer only"" and accused me of falsely listing: https://support.vividseats.com/support/solutions/articles/11000021674-what-types-of-tickets-can-i-sell-what-types-can-t-i-sell-"
"Ordered 2 tickets through Vivid Seats and when we received the charge on our MasterCard it was $100 higher than the tickets were. Was told there is a service charge, but absolutely no mention of anything till after you've entered all the payment info. Must have been in the smallest print possible because I still can't find it! Was told by customer service no refund but if I'm not happy I can sell my tickets online??? Seriously! Stick with a reputable company like Ticketmaster. Never again Vivid Seats!"
"I ordered tickets to Head and the Heart on 3/3/19 (the day they went on sale). I received an email on 4/11/19 that my order had been canceled and a refund had been issued. Ordered different tickets on the same day from Vivid. On the day of the concert 4/16/19, I talked to them at 1 pm (via chat), 3 pm (via phone) and was finally told at 5:30 pm (via phone) that the ""seller had dropped the ball"" and I did not get the tickets I ordered for an 8:00 pm show. I got a full refund and they provided with me with two nosebleed seats that couldn't have been more than $20/ticket. Will never order from them again."
"We purchased tickets for a Lakers NBA game at the Staples Centre in December. We purchased these months in advance as we were travelling from Australia to see the game. We did not receive an email with the tickets until less than 24 hours before. Upon arrival our tickets were denied entry due to being a blurry screenshot, not an original ticket supplied by Vivid Seats. We called customer service and spoke to Olivia. Olivia made us wait on hold up 30 minutes while she tried to source the original tickets and told us not to go buy new ones as she could not guarantee any refund. "
I paid over $7900 for 2019 NCAA final four tickets to Vivid seats. They did not deliver the tickets in time to attend the event. They said they would attempt to reissue the tickets in time. They said if they were not received in time they would provide a full refund. Now they will not give me a refund. I I have never been ripped off like this ever. Never use Vivid Seats! Scam!
I bought ticket for Pink concert April 13th Saturday in Honda center from Vivid Seats 5 months earlier. They sold expensive ticket for 4th level for $84. (440) I found the second floor for $74 from box office same day of the show. You should be ashamed of yourself. Overselling seats that you can find from Ticketmaster.com for much cheaper. The box office lady told me that original ticket they bought for my seats was $55. At least with Ticketmaster or their box office you can upgrade. I feel my money was just wasted! People be aware. Do not buy from this website. You are just wasting your money. (** order Number.)
We came 2200 miles to watch a Texas Rangers game which got rained out and rescheduled for June. Well we aren’t going to stay or spend that money to come for that game. We’re not rich. Their pat policy answer was to sell the tickets on own in Canada. They kept on this over and over. With at least five different employees. They had no concern for our situation and left us on hold many times where we thought we had been let go. All we wanted to do is use the money from the tickets to go to a game the same week we are in Texas. It’s rocket science. But they would not move past their written in book answers. No help how to sell the tickets from another country away and the lost of selling tickets we have to find without help as they tell us.
"I purchased 2 tickets from Vivid Seats on March 15, 2019 for a game to be played on April 7th. I received an email on March 22 informing me the tickets had been sent. I called customer service letting them know the tickets had not arrived. I continued calling over a three week period trying to resolve my concern about not receiving the tickets. Vivid proclaims that they have a 100 percent customer satisfaction policy ""Peace of Mind"". I can only say I have never experience less peace of mind when dealing with a company... Their policy is to never refund a purchase. Haha, I found out the hard way, but you don't have to. This is a warning. ""NEVER USE VIVID SEATS FOR ANY PURPOSE""."
"I would strongly recommend that you buy your tickets elsewhere due to the dissatisfactory customer service I have been receiving by Vivid Seats. They do not care about their customers as I have emailed them 20 times, tried to live chat them, called them 35 times without any response. I have been trying to speak to a manager or supervisor about some issues regarding my ticket however no one is bothering to reply to my emails or even send me an EXT number so I can contact them. REALLY unhappy with my experience with Vivid Seats! Save yourself the time and money and gain a better customer service experience by buying your tickets elsewhere."
Don’t even dare buying your tickets using this website. I end up paying for a VIP ticket but it won’t let me download my ticket but instead a 25 GA ticket was given to me. I want the rest of my money back. I tried looking for a customer service number but they don’t even have any...need to shut this website down!!!
"I bought tickets that were $250 each. When the bill came it was $644!! I called and they told me their ""system calculates the service fee!"" Apparently the service fee for sending tickets via email is $137!! I asked for more specifics, but they kept telling me the same thing: ""We charge that to guarantee that you get tickets."" This arbitrary amount added on top of the bill is ridiculous. He said it was on the website when I ordered the tickets, but if such a large amount had been clearly displayed to me, I would not have moved forward with the purchase. He then said he would transfer me to a supervisor. I was put on hold in forever status, because no one ever came back to the phone. Do not use their services. You can get tickets without these ridiculous hidden fees anywhere else."
"My wife paid $922 for two tickets for INK with PayPal to Vivid Seats. Vivid Seats confirmed the transaction. Later the same day they sent the following: ""Your Vivid Seats order 2656... for INK has been set for cancellation, as we cannot accept orders from individuals who have attempted to withhold payment for past ticket orders from US or from another company in our industry."""
"Purchased 2 tickets to a concert. Received email that they had been delivered to Flash seats. I look in Flash Seats and there are no tickets. I emailed, chatted and spoke to a couple of ESL customer service reps who had difficulty understanding why I had a problem. However, the answer I got? I, the customer, have to do the work to fix the problem. I have to take the time to set up a new email account and a new Flash Seats account because they have no way to interact with Flash Seats. That is obviously not the case since they have to send the tickets to Flash Seats for me to use them. The most ridiculous and laughable customer service I have ever encountered."
"NOLA VIP rip off. No Stones. No Fleetwood Mac. No refund. We have now paid $1,000+ for one day tickets to see bands I’ve never heard of. Never, never, never buy tickets from a reseller! Lesson learned. Bye Felicia and Adios Vivid! Grrrr...."
"Purchased 2 tickets Thursday am for a baseball game. Was sent an email that I would have link to tickets in a hour. Never got link, called Friday and was told I have to wait until Saturday am. I called back Saturday 3 hours before the event and was told tickets might not be available until 1 hr before start of game. Such BS... I explained I needed to drive to venue and did not want to do so if I did not have tickets in hand. They said be patient, which causes a lot of stress going to a fun event. Eventually I got my tickets 1/2 hr before start of the game. Customer service was horrible. They just protect their sellers and not the buyer. If you want a stress free process of buying tickets DO NOT BUY from VIVID SEATS."
"Online purchased 2 tickets to the Tyler Perry's ""Madea's Farewell Tour"". Purchase price for 2 tickets, 12-13 rows from stage. Charge to my credit card $651. When I printed my tickets hours before the play, To my surprise each ticket states, ""PRICE & ALL TAX $89.75""!!! I was overcharged $471.00!!! on 2 tickets. Too late to get on phone to complain, as theater was 2 hours away from my location. How can I complain and try to get some of my money back? THIS WAS A TOTAL RIP OFF FINANCIALLY!"
"I purchased 6 tickets for Ron White for 4/27 in Napa, CA. The tickets were $151.00 each. My credit card was charged $1153.62. I got on chat line to go over and before I could respond, that chat was ended. They give 30 seconds for a response. I was told it was a service charge. I never saw one reflected anywhere. I have never seen that with other resellers. You need negative numbers to rate Vivid Seats."
"I bought 4 tickets online from Vivid Seats for the Hypocrisy/Fleshgod Apocalypse show at Bottom Lounge (Chicago, IL) on April 5th 2019. Me and my brother drove 3 hours to get there, and met a cousin and a friend in Chicago and headed to the venue. We get there and the guy tries to scan the tickets... but they weren't working. I told them I bought them online from Vivid Seats. He looks up at me and says ""Yeah, you guys have been ripped off"". I was shocked. He said Vivid Seats bought tickets from them, and before the show canceled their tickets and got a refund. So these tickets were no good. They already knew there would be problems, and already banned Vivid Seats from buying future tickets from them. Luckily for us he said don't worry about it and let us in. I will never buy from the thieves at Vivid Seats again. I'm currently disputing the charge as thieves don't deserve my money. The venue and the bands deserve it."
I will never buy another ticket from this place. I bought tickets to Ozzy and he postponed his tour until next year. Cannot get a refund and customer service argued with me. Very rude. The set up is not fair to the buyers. I would NOT recommend Vivid Seats.
"Bought tickets to Rolling Stones at Jazz Fest NO. The Stones cancelled their tour. Tickets were higher and harder to get, so the charges were higher. The website states there will be refunds for all cancelled shows. The Stones cancelled the entire North American tour, using the words ""cancelled."" Vivid Seats is not standing behind their advertising, and does not disclose their true policy. Nobody should buy tickets from them."
Consumer service is ridiculous; they only argue with you. Sellers can fraudulently misrepresent the tickets and Vivid Seats only protects the sellers. If you absolutely must use this service then make sure you take screenshots of each part of the transaction -- especially the first screen when choosing your tickets. My husband and I were completely ripped off.
"They charged three times the price of the concert ticket in addition to a $58 fee that was not specified upfront. I called about the fee and they would not do anything. I was told the tickets would be at Will Call. When I got to the venue there were no tickets in my name at Will Call. I had to purchase additional tickets at the box office to see the show. The box office said that Vivid Seats was not authorized to sell their tickets. Sadly I was not the only one who purchased from Vivid, lots of disappointed and angry people at the venue."
"Vivid allowed me to create an account to sell concert tickets and my listing states active. Several days went by and noticed the tickets were never posted. I called customer service and they did not post them since I am a new seller? The tickets did not pass their validation process because they were not purchased through them? I was never notified through e-mail. Customer Service stated, they do not notify you when ticket validation issues. I have purchased many tickets through them, but no longer."
"Just check other websites first. The prices can be even double the price of other websites and they do not have any evaluation system for that. They do not let you sell a ticket that is for an event in Toronto, so you can just sell your ticket if it is in the US. They do not refund a penny to you and no price match. Total ROBBERY."
"Their telephone customer service is awful. When I called about the last minute delivery of my very costly Pink tickets via email I could reach no one. I went through a vast array of prompts and pre-recorded questions, none of which applied to my question. I tried their online chat multiple times and was left holding. This is all avoidance on Vivid Seats behalf. They get your money and its a wrap. In the end, the tickets were bad, as there was a cameraman right in front me & my wife's field of vision. Post concert I received an email from Vivid asking if I had a ""photograph"" of the view, to which my answer was ""why would I photograph a bad view""? In the end I got screwed and what was supposed to be a special night out for my wife was ruined. My experiences with Stub Hub have been good, and these folks will call you back if there is an issue. I'll stick with them. Adios Vivid Seats!"
"I purchased two tickets to an event that did not get sent to me until I called multiple times. They were sent the day of the event as Android screenshots. These screenshots did NOT scan at the gate and we were unable to attend. After contacting Vivid Seats again, I was told that I had to provide a letter (on letterhead) from the event center stating that I could not attend. Why would anyone have asked for that while standing in the event line being denied entrance? Customer service is a 0. Customer resolution is a 0. My recommendation is to stay away from Vivid Seats if you want to attend the event you pay for."
"Selling Tickets. There is no one you can talk to. I bought tickets to the Oregon vs Auburn game. A friend of mine backed out. The PDF ticket will not be sent to my phone until a day or two before the game. Vivid said, ""You're not a large ticket holder so you can't list and once you receive your PDF you're on your own."" First and last time for this company. Back to StubHub."
I purchased baseball tickets and the service fees and deliver charge cost more than the tickets. I cannot get hold of a live person at Vivid seats to discuss this. I am very disappointed in their lack of customer service. I left messages for a call back & nothing. You cannot call them and speak to a live person. Why?
"I have spent 3 hours to get my tickets which never came! Avoid!!! Tried to chat online - poor service, ten consultants tried to help but no result. Avoid!!! If you want to spend your time to get what you paid for you. :)"
"I purchased tickets to the NCAA First Four game in Dayton, OH. First, they ware advertised $21 each, but the total charge was $89 for 3 tickets. When I tried to get the tickets to enter the game (after I was already there), the link to transfer the tickets had expired. There was no phone number or support. I assumed they sold the tickets to someone else. The next day I found a phone number and they refused to provide a refund. They claimed they did not sell to someone else. Either way, I paid for the tickets, could not use them, did not get into the event after driving there and parking, and did not get a refund. Will never use these people again."
"BEWARE of vividseats.com. First of all, I purchased two tickets to the ACC Tournament Basketball Game at the Spectrum Center on March 15, 2019 to see the Duke/Carolina Game. The gentleman, Carlos, the seller at Vivid Seats stated during our conversation that we could pick up the two tickets at the Will Call at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. When we arrived at the Spectrum Center at Will Call, there were approximately 20 people standing there on their phones. I knew immediately when I walked into the Spectrum Center that something was wrong because there was people screaming into their phones. They all were really, really angry. We asked the man at the Will Call Office for our tickets. He stated that Vivid Seats was selling tickets that weren't really there and that all of those people in the lobby had paid for tickets that Vivid Seats was not providing. "
"We purchased concert tickets, we then couldn't attend the concert so we tried to sell them and it was the BIGGEST HASSLE EVER!! I was not able to transfer my tickets to anyone that didn't have a smartphone. When I asked the Representative (Michael) if something else could be done his response was ""well, they'll just have to borrow a smartphone."" Their fees are outrageous, their phone service is non-existent, if you need customer service you will need to get on their chat. I WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY EVER AGAIN! I was not able to leave the ""stars to rate"" blank. This is why I gave them one star otherwise it would be blank."
I purchased tickets on 3/1/19 for a show in May. I hit the accept button and then saw the charges they charged for a 75.00 ticket = 248.00 + their fees. I called them right away to back out the sale. After chatting with 2 reps. They said no refunds - All sales final. Explained I didn't want the tickets. They refused. Then I saw all the complaints through various websites on how awful this merchant is. I worked in Risk for a Credit card processing Company for Merchants. A merchant like this would have been shut down immediately for kind of negativity. 
"I was shocked to see that I was charged $102 for 2 tickets advertised as $38. It's a big jump and it was unannounced so a total surprise. Not happy about it. After my complaint Vivid Seats said there are charges and fees amounting to $16 (steep for a ticket priced at $38 - delivery $5, for an electronic download, what delivery???). 42% markup is robbery. It's excessive. And they claimed it was visible before I paid. This is simply not true. Had it been communicated on the payment page I would not have closed the window and gone somewhere else."
I had purchased tickets as a gift and received a confirmation number. I then received an email from Vivid Seats and was informed by a customer service agent that the tickets were no longer available. No commensurate seats were available and I was not offered any discount on other seats to compensate for the very negative experience. Avoid this company.
"I bought two tickets to Michael Buble in Denver on July 13th. Each of my tickets cost $196, for a total of $392. I checked out, and VividSeats sent me an email showing that they charged my credit card $508.90. WITW!?? So I called Customer Service and was told that a $7.50 charge for Flash Seats delivery, and a $54/per ticket charge for a Vivid Seats ""service fee"" was added. Despite their claims, the fees were NEVER DISCLOSED anywhere on their website or during checkout. They claim that they're just ""a marketplace connecting buyers and sellers."" So no refunds. And all sales are final. Nobody could show me where ANY fees are disclosed in the checkout process. This is outright theft."
To start off I bought spring season tickets to a Cubs-White Sox game. Bought the tickets 30 minutes before the game had started. Well 20 minutes later I never got the tickets so I called in to Vivid Seats and the girl said she would give me an upgrade for the same price so I said why can I just have the seats that I bought. She said the seller had an issue. Who knows. This was the 2nd time this has happened in the last 3 months. I went ahead and took the tickets because I want to take my daughter to 8 Spring training baseball game which were a $100 seats for Spring training that's a very good seat.
"Vivid Seats sold me concert tickets, come day of show I had no tickets to recall thru their friend Flash Seats. Flash Seats said the seller, who is someone Vivid Seats did business with, retracted the tickets. Vivid Seats wants to throw the blame but bottom line I paid on my end, they failed to produce the tickets or give me a refund. Giving them a 1 star rating is too good for them. They don't deserve any stars!"
"I bought tickets yesterday, the event starts in 2 hours and I still do not have tickets emailed. THIS IS A SCAM COMPANY. They do not sell tickets, they take your money then they look for tickets, you will never get your tickets. IT'S A SCAM."
"On February 23rd I purchased 2 tickets via Vivid Seats. The credit card was promptly charged with a sizable fee. The confirmation for the March 8th performance read: ""Your tickets are expected to be sent by 03/07/2019."" I am writing this on March 7 @ 7 PM and do not have the tickets. Called them and was advised to wait until midnight. What kind of service is that? If you can't deliver as promised, don't 'wait' - communicate with customer instead of waiting till the last minute. Never will I use them again and don't advise others either."
"After purchasing tickets online from Vivid Seats, the website stated that I would receive a confirmation via email followed by a separate email that would contain the tickets. The confirmation arrived as stated but continued to state that the tickets would not be forwarded until the day of the event which was three weeks away. This practice is completely misleading. They drafted my credit card for the full price of the tickets three weeks in advance and failed to provide the tickets via the email that was supposed to immediately follow the confirmation. I was forced to purchase additional tickets and was not able to use the ones provided at the much later date by Vivid Seats. I recommend purchasing tickets elsewhere."
I purchased tickets on two different occasions. Last week purchased 2 tickets and was charged $60.00 for a service fee. Which is insane! Then I purchased more tickets a week later and was not aware I was getting charged 157.00 for a service charge. It was after I purchased I realized how much the fee increased on my debit. When I called they said no credit could be given and they have the right to charge whatever fees they want. I called 2x and 2nd time I was given a credit of $79 towards new tickets. I will never purchase from them. Complete rip off!!!
"I've purchased from Vivid Seats 5 times and I've never disappointed. Each event I purchased was sold out and Vivid would often be my last resort. 3 P!ATD concerts, 1 TOP concert, and 1 BTS concert. Each seat was in the right location, I received my tickets early except for Twenty One Pilots. I didn't receive an email for the tickets 'til the month of the show. They explained before the purchase that it was for security purposes, which it did bother me a bit. Another flaw is the fees. The fees definitely depend on what type of ticket you're after. BTS was one of the hottest events that I purchased and their fee was $100 for each ticket. Sounds ridiculous, which it really is. I remember P!ATD and TOP being around $50 which isn't far from Ticketmaster fees I believe. Overall, Vivid Seats has always given me a wonderful experience and a wonderful way to get tickets to sold out shows. As long as you're okay with the fees, you should be happy."
"First and last time I will ever be affiliated with this company. I purchased a concert ticket for almost $270. I purchased the ticket nine months before the event. I was told the ticket would be delivered by one week before the event. I was sent what looked like a ticket. I show up at the venue, which took me 2 hours to drive to one way (four hours total drive time) just to be told what I was sent from Vivid was not a real ticket. Long story short, I never got into the show. I called Vivid while at the venue and tried to get the ticket and got no help. I called multiple times and was flat out lied to on multiple occasions. When I called them on their lies, they sheepishly admitted, but said there was nothing they could do. They kept saying they had proof the tickets were sent, but couldn't ever provide that proof (there was no proof). I started a dispute with my bank. "
"First time purchase and last time purchase. I purchased 2 tickets for BTS concert on May 4, 2019. Over $3,300.00 for them with Vivid Seats, their fees of around $700.00. I thought for them charging that fee I would have exceptional service. Normal fee is 10%, I was wrong! I found out AFTER CHECKOUT/PURCHASE that my tickets would not arrive till May 3, 2019, shipping date May 2, 2019, day before the concert, (two months after purchase). I contacted them and have had nothing but the runaround, they said, ""The agreement states your tickets may not arrive till closer to the date."" "
"I purchased tickets on 1/27 for my wife birthday weekend in Vegas (weekend of 3/2). The order stated I will get my tickets by 3/1. I chatted with 2 customer service reps on 3/1 and both time they stated that they are still looking to get tickets from a broker service. In other words, they had over a month after charging my credit cards to find the tickets I purchased and are not successful doing so. They just give me the run around. Not to all, stay away from this subpar ticketing service. This is the first and last time I will use Vivid Seats."
"Just letting other people know how Vivid Seats treated us after being a loyal customer and stole money from us. We purchased tickets few months ahead to the event and couldn’t attend. So we sold the same tickets on their website again, after some time they contacted us and told us that the person that bought the tickets was not able to enter the event. We sent all the proof all the emails from them that we received the tickets from them and sold back on their website, didn’t receive any response and after which they just charged us for $300. The tickets were only $180. So far no response, I would not recommend to deal with them, they have horrible customer service and they steal money from their customers!"
"I never write a bad review, so much so that this is my first time ever and keep in mind that there's bad service pretty much everywhere. However, this particular experience with Vivid Seats was the worst! I was trying to sell tickets with them and needed help finalizing the sale. I tried to contact them through chat, email and called them to try and understand the process and fix the problem I was having while selling the tickets. No one reply to my email/chat messages and in the end I was charged the amount I listed my ticket for. Stay away from this scam called Vivid Seats. What a shame!"
Dec 2018... We tried to purchase tickets to IIHF hockey online from Vivid Seats... Didn't work. So we ended up buying the tickets from their customer service with the understanding that they were pdf and we could print them out. They emailed us the tickets and then we find out they are for a smartphone only. We don't have smartphones. Talked to customer service and they told us that we knew this before we bought them (wrong!). So they tell us they will send us pdf tickets. We get them and they are again smartphone tickets. We phone them back and they tell us to borrow a smartphone from somebody. 
"Purchased 4 tickets for a Phillies Spring training game. They offered redeemable insurance for any circumstances for $31.00. Stated that 900+ people have already purchased said insurance. When I was unable to attend the game I asked for my refund & was directed to contact Alliance Insurance Co. When I called Alliance they told me they had no record of the purchase. My credit card company sent me a confirmation of the insurance purchase. Vivid Seats acknowledged that the insurance purchase was valid, but refused to refund me the money. If I could give Vivid Seats & their customer service a zero I would."
Please go to the Venue and purchase your tickets. I had a bad experience with the tickets purchase from this Company. I paid $293.38 for tickets to see Tyler Perry Show. I wasn’t able to see the show because view obstruction from an overhead projector. Spoke with customer service. They said they had nothing to do with that. They just sell tickets. Some Customer Service. Buyer Beware... I was told they could not refund some of my money back. The only solution compensation credit of $59.00 for future tickets. Because they don’t make money off of the Tickets Third Party Vendor. I refused the credit. If you’re not aware of the Venue seating you should not be selling tickets.
"If I could give this company zero stars, I would. They charge just as much in fees as they do the price of the actual ticket, then claim you check a box acknowledging that tickets may be higher than market rate. DO NOT EVER BUY FROM THIS AGENCY. GO DIRECTLY TO THE SOURCE OR VENUE FOR THE TICKETS, INSTEAD. Companies like this only exist because of their predatory practices, including taking far too much money from their sellers and then price gauging buyers. I cannot believe these third-party ticket sellers are allowed to treat customers like this! What a complete sham. I tried to buy tickets to the Austin Rodeo and somehow this agency showed up as the first ticket vendor. "
Charged me for seats in a almost straight section for a concert and was even give an assigned area which looked great. When e-mailed the tickets I was sitting sideways in the arena. Called customer service after try to get someone live chatting for almost an hour and then finally got to supervisor who proceeded to tell me they are within their guidelines because the tickets can be comparable. So there is nothing they are willing to do.
"I bought NBA tickets in August 2018 on Vivid Seats for a Feb. 2019 event. When I have bought resale tickets at other vendors before, the tickets are immediately transferred to my name and then 48 hours before, the tickets show up for mobile tickets. At Vivid Seats, you wait until 48 hours before for the owner to transfer them. It is now less than a day away and the owner has not transferred them. I have already called Vivid Seats twice. I think it is set up this way, so scalpers can try to sell their tickets on several sites and see which site they get the best money for the tickets!!! My tickets will probably never show as this is a high demand game. Vivid Seats claims if no show, I will get a refund after 2 hours before! What if I were traveling from out of town and now no tickets?! They have held my money for 6 months and now no tickets. Either Vivid Seats should be forced to change their delivery policy or they should be shut down. Stay away!!!"
"Made a last minute purchase, a little more than 48 hours prior to the event, with the tickets advertised as overnight delivery guaranteed to be delivered the day of the event. Needless to say that didn't happen. Contacted Vivid once I knew UPS was done delivering for the day (around 2pm) and the tracking number was coming up as ""Unknown"", but they wanted to give UPS every opportunity to arrive before cancelling my order or replacing my tickets. Fair enough, even though I know UPS in my area; they were never going to show. I was right, but making you wait until the last second so everything is rushed is part of the scam."
I contacted customer service 24 hrs before the event as I still not received the tickets and was reassured I would receive them. I called a few hours before the event as I had not received them and they were closed! I am now fighting for a refund. TERRIBLE!
"I will never go through this company again! Worst customer service I ever had. Tells you about anything on the phone, don't listen to you, do not understand what you are saying, because most of the agent are Spanish. We finally got our tickets the day of the game. Had to call numerous times to be able to solve the problem. Don't waste your time and energy!"
"I, like several other reviewers did not see any notice that I would be charged an additional charges above the ticket price that was posted. When I saw that my credit card was charged an additional 25 percent above the purchase price I immediately contacted vividseats.com and was told that I was shown the charges twice before confirming the purchase. I did not see the charges. They told me that it was against company policy to offer refunds. What a scam. I hope I get the tickets but I do not trust this outfit. STAY AWAY."
"I purchased tickets from Vivid Seats on November 14th 2018 for the Michael Bublé concert on February 15th. As of today, 3 months from purchase, I still have not received the tickets. The site says the tickets may be delivered up until the day of the concert so I'm still hopeful that they will arrive in the next 24 hours. This is by far the worst ticket buying experience I've ever had. I will never use this company again."
"I purchased tickets to Panic! At The Disco for February 4th at Allstate Arena in Illinois. They were paper tickets - awesome seats, and below ticket value! When we drove from out of state and arrived at the venue, we were told they were counterfeit... And that they see these tickets all the time. Apparently they will be going to all digital to try to cut down on the scams - but from what I’m reading here Vivid Seats will screw you ANY way they can. BUYER BEWARE."
"AVOID USING THIS COMPANY - YOU WILL BE RIPPED OFF! I made the mistake of buying tickets online through Vivid to Paul McCartney concert in Vancouver. I expected a cost of $708 US to be charged to my credit card on PayPal. Instead, the total was over $900! I immediately tried to cancel the transaction but Vivid said a courteous NO and PayPal in my mind has been complicit in this fraud. Before I hit the 'purchase' button online I saw nothing showing the final or true overall cost. PLEASE be careful and AVOID VIVID!"
"I tried to make an online purchase with my debit card for concert tickets with Vivid Seats. Before I finalized the transaction, I decide to use a different credit card. I proceeded with my 2nd attempt of purchasing tickets with Vivid Seats, which went well, with my regular VISA card. The next day when I tried to use my debit card while running errands, my debit card was declined twice. When I arrived home, I checked my bank account online, couldn't find the problem, so I called my bank. Thankfully the bank rep with whom I spoke was able to see that Vivid Seats had tried to put the first transaction through so many times that I was denied use of my debit card elsewhere. I don't know how they were able to do it, but they caused the problem with my account, just sayin', LOOK OUT!!!"
I purchased and paid for tickets to a 1:00 PM game. They notified me that the game time had been changed to 7:00 PM. We are an elderly couple and cannot drive after dark. That is why we chose a 1:00 PM game. Vivid Seats will not refund us our money or let us choose another game. I think this is very unfair because we did not want to attend a night game. NEVER AGAIN Vivid Seats!
"NO EXCHANGE permitted several weeks in advance of show when purchaser discovered inability to attend. I was not requesting REFUND, only a different date to attend performance by same performer. ATTITUDE of Vivid employee hostile and dismissive too."
"Has anyone started a class action lawsuit against these scam artists yet? Santana tickets went on sale at 10:00 AM the morning of Friday, January 25th and I was concerned they would see out quickly so I made it point to set an alarm to go online and buy them. The first ""Sponsored"" links I found selling tickets for the show was Vivid Seats so that's where I went. Their website is (intentionally) opaque so they appear to be a legitimate direct ticket vendor. There is no outward indication that their platform is just a site for scalpers to resell their tickets. So I found my two tickets for $109 each and bought them and for whatever reason did not realize the total was $286.38 instead of $218 until I got the receipt emailed to me fairly immediately."
Was tricked into entering ticket.com site instead of Ticketmaster. Paid 288.00 for two tickets instead of 80. ** up company with no way to contact them. They should be forced out of business. DO NOT use them. Ever.
I recently ordered 2 tickets to a sporting event. I purchased them on 1/30/2019 and as of today 2/8/2019 I have yet to receive my ticket information. I'm told 100% guarantee for my tickets but can't get an explanation why I have not received my tickets. I plan to dispute the charge for the tickets with my credit card company and purchase using StubHub. These guys are scam artists with their policies.
"I spent $650 on Hamilton tickets. The seat said ADA accessible, which would mean it is accessible with someone using a wheelchair. It DID NOT say ADA seat. When the tickets were transferred it said they were wheelchair seats. There is actually not a seat there just an open areas for a wheelchair and the venue doesn’t provide a seat otherwise. Vivid claims no responsibility even though that was never stated during the ticket sale and thinks that is fair practice. Now I’m left with no seats at all. Such a deceptive and disgusting company. Just be honest about the seats you're selling so a consumer can make an informed decision. A bait and switch where now we actually didn’t buy a seat at all with no recourse. There are so many great resale sites - used StubHub recently and they are fantastic. STAY AWAY FROM VIVID."
"After paying the highest service fee of my life for tickets, I had my email rejected from online service 4 times. After giving up on that route, I went to the phones for a convoluted series of connections that was worse than anything at any cable company. Disgrace."
"I had a similar problem as some people stated. I bought tickets to a game and the seller sent me an email to transfer the ticket but when I put my information in it said invalid user. I could still log on but every time the link wouldn’t work. I tried calling and you can’t get a person! I felt like I had gotten scammed! Finally I tried clicking the link, create a new account (even though I already had 1) and I used a different email address. It worked!!! Really I was just relieved that I didn’t lose my $ and chance to go. Hope this post helps someone, because Vivid Seats certainly was no help. I will never use them again, I’ve never had a problem with StubHub, so I recommend going in that direction. Good luck strangers!!"
"There is a reason that 210 of the 234 reviews are one-star ratings...this company is garbage! Note: they do not ""sell"" tickets. They sell tickets for others at an enormous profit. OK, fine. That's the American way. However, they've got no clue how to do this properly! I purchased 4 tickets for a Spring Training baseball game in Arizona at the Cubs' home field, Sloan Field. The tickets were ""granted"" by the seller. I received a message that he had agreed to sell the tickets, and that I would have to click on a link to ""Accept"" the tickets. Then, I was to transfer the electronic tickets to a MLB Ballpark phone app as the ONLY way to officially use the tickets. Well, that didn't happen. "
"Purchased 2 tickets to Hamilton through Vivid Seats in the orchestra section. No mention of obstructed view upon purchase of tickets and there was mention of it on many other tickets that's why I chose these. Upon arrival we are seated behind and to the left, about 10 feet to the left, of a huge tower from floor to ceiling of speakers with the addition of a huge tower of lights sticking out past the huge tower of speakers from the floor to the ceiling as well. Needless to say seeing 10% of the stage was not what anyone has in mind after spending $1200.00 on 2 tickets. "
"After purchasing NBA tickets, I discovered that my seats were not actually seats, but for SRO section in arena. This was disclosed after purchase. Though Vivid Seats has a resale program, I was not allowed to list my tickets through the site as they were e-tickets. Don't be mislead by Vivid Seats."
"The site does not highlight details of their charges as they know you wouldn't buy. When I got my confirmation email showing $80 more than the ticket prices I immediately called to cancel the order. They refused claiming that they can't because they're a ""market place"". As someone in the online retail space, I can tell you that's **. Credit charges can take 24 to 48 hours to post and even longer for the seller to get their cash. From Vivid's website: ""Sellers typically receive payments issued to their registered Paypal accounts not more than fourteen (14) business days after delivery to buyer, regardless of method of delivery, unless otherwise agreed to by Vivid Seats."" The transaction could easily be canceled, but they refuse because they would have little business for the outrageous fees they charged. I'm disputing with my credit card company because I refuse to be scammed."
"Purchased tickets for a Justin Timberlake concert, the company did provide us with a timely email when the concert was rescheduled from October to January. However, when we arrived at the venue with our printed tickets they did not scan and we were denied access to the concert. We confirmed at the ticket window that there was something wrong with the tickets, and that the barcode had been changed numerous times. When we called Vivid Seats they informed us that they would open an investigation, but there was nothing they could do to grant us access to the concert. We asked for different seats but they claimed that wasn’t an option. We wasted an entire evening traveling into NYC just to get turned around at the door and told to go home. I will never use this service again."
Wish I read the reviews in advanced. Purchased hockey tickets for this event and after purchasing they offered a discount for parking at the same event. Advertising parking for 16$. Once we purchased we realized the price had jumped up to 43$. Immediately called and was told that there was a shipping fee and once the buyer reached out to us we would be told how we were going to receive this ticket. This game is in 2 days away and there are no refunds. DO NOT BOOK HERE.
I purchased tickets from Vivid Seats. Bob ** for my husband's birthday gift. Arrived at venue and was allowed access with tickets - went to seats and our row and seat did not exist. They told us to go sit someplace else. And offered a seat in the upper section behind the stage (we bought floor seats). Vivid opened an investigation and after 7 days (5 business days) called to inform me that they could not refund my money because they could not confirm we didn’t have seats. 100% customer satisfaction guarantee??? NO. They could care less about you after they get your money.
"This company is insane. DO NOT SELL TICKETS HERE. I was selling tickets on here. I actually got someone else to buy my tickets so I was going to cancel the order anyway. I got a text from Vivid Seats stating. ""Your immediate action is required. This is your second notice regarding the sale of your tickets. Please verify your sale as soon as possible or your sale may be at risk of cancelation."" There was a link. Nowhere did the link say what it was doing. I clicked the link and it automatically accepted the sale. When I looked up how to cancel ticket sales it was there would be a reject or accept button. That was not the case. I called to get this all figured out and they told me there was nothing they could do and that there would be a fee of $130 or more per ticket, and to call back after the weekend to speak to a manager. "
"I purchased 3 tickets for $174 each, but was charged an extra $147 in fees. I tried to immediately dispute it and get a refund, but it was in tiny print. I don't need reader glasses, but I should've had some on for this purchase. BEWARE!"
I purchased tickets for an out of state event to attend while I was on vacation. The performer rescheduled the event for months later and I won't be able to come back. I received an email from Ticketmaster saying they would issue a refund. Vivid Seats won't honor the refund. What 100% guarantee?
This company is misrepresenting the fact that they have no products to sell. After 6 weeks and multiple calls I still don’t have my tickets. It has become impossible to resell. 100% money back guarantee is 100% false! Do not support this company. They are a complete scam.
"They can sell you a ticket for $107 but when you get the ticket it is really a $38 ticket! When you call them, they say they have no control over it and you should have known... Nowhere is it obvious that a ticket can be scalped on this site."
"I purchased tickets to Kaaboo 2018 from Vivid Seats. When I arrived I could not get into the venue because my ticket had another person's name on it. Vivid sold me the ticket with this name on it. I saw they had a 100 percent guarantee to back them up. Well, I still could not get in. They would not give me a refund either because they state they needed a paper saying I could not get in. The booth at the door is where they hand over your bracelets, but they do not provide anything to you and tell you they can't help you at the door."
"I created an account. Followed all the procedures and policies to list some tickets for sale. My profile indicates the tickets have been listed for 3 days. But Vivid Seats does not have them listed on their site. I called, and was told that an individual cannot list tickets for sale unless he/she already bought the particular tickets from Vivid Seats at a resale price. Funny. The site let me sign up, and then indicates in my profile that they are listed. This is a BS company. Waste of time and effort, and devious in that they never advised in their site that individuals can’t sell tickets."
"Last night I purchased two tickets to see the 5th Dimension. ""Please wait"" came up in a red button. 30 minutes went by. 60 minutes. Finally I refreshed the page. Up came the ticket for an extra $103! I felt gypped but since my husband and I had already made arrangements for an 800 mile RT to the concert I decided to buy the tickets anyway. Same thing happened and this time the price was even higher! Got ""Please wait"" again. Then this morning, an ad for the concert appeared in my Facebook feed."
"Don't ever use this place to buy tickets. I purchased a ticket and it was for an incorrect venue, which I immediately purchased the correct ticket. I called like everyone else and was told they don't issue refunds and to sell the ticket. I asked for info on how to sell the ticket and was told I could research it. I called again and was told they wouldn't allow me to sell it because I am not a broker or professional. I warn everyone not to use this ""company"" and I use that loosely. They are a joke."
"My daughter and I wanted to see Metallica at PNC stadium on January 28, 2019 (Have not attended yet obviously). I went to PNC to try to purchase the tickets direct, but was funneled over to Vivid. We purchased the tickets almost a year in advance; We picked two decent seats for $489 apiece. When I received the tickets, the face value was $131 apiece. This is nothing more that price gouging at its finest. I called Vivid and got the generic response that they have to make money also. Never again VIVID!!! This is a scam and a rip off to working folks who simply want some enjoyment and entertainment. This whole thing really upsets me. I'm a business person who makes a profit with my work and could not get away with how VIVID, along with their greedy investment companies rip off the masses. I sure as heck don't blame the artists, their prices are affordable. They should be upset about this also."
"Please consider this review and many others before purchasing tickets from Vivid Seats. I accessed the Vivid Seat's site to purchase tickets for the Houston Rodeo. I wanted to surprise my daughter and son with tickets. I selected a section to review tickets available. The system automatically assigned the most expensive tickets. When I went to go back to review the seats available, the system automatically processed tickets that I did not want and that I did not purchase in the amount of $3632.75. "
"My husband purchased 2 tickets for the Justin Timberlake concert tonight. We get to the venue and are tickets are invalid. The seats do not actually exist. Called customer service to get help and all they could do was apologize because there were no alternative seats for us to have. When my husband continued to question them on their business practices, the associate just laughed and said there was nothing she could do. When he asked for a refund, she stated that it would have to be “investigated”. This place is a scam."
Purchased four tickets from Vivid Seats and paid twice the value of the tickets. Arrived near the vicinity of the concert (Allstate Arena Rosemont) at 6:45 p.m concert was to begin at 8 p.m. We sat in traffic on Higgins road for an hour without moving one inch. We observed people being turned away from the parking area that we were trying to turn into. People were screaming at each other and cursing because they were mad they were still sitting in traffic and knew at this point they were missing the concert. 
"These people are scam artists pretending to be 1st tier ticket sellers. My daughter searched for tickets to a concert and the 1st item that came up was for Vivid Seats. They sell seats that cost 37% more than 1st tier resellers. Me being an ignorant old man, when my daughter sent the link to me to get the tickets just assumed that this is a legitimate seller. I purchased the tickets for her, and found out a few minutes later that they were tickets issued by Ticketmaster, so I went to Ticketmaster and found out they actually had the same seats for $70 less. I have not been able to get any of these fraudsters to correct the problem. Even My bank wouldn't help me with the issue."
My tickets were terrible. Twice face value...and an embarrassment to a parent that was trying to give my kids a good time. Vivid Seats are a joke and a scam. I highly recommend you NEVER use this service! I beg not to.
"I purchased tickets for a certain section. It took nearly a year to get the tickets. When I received the tickets they were for a completely different section. The tickets were not cheap. When I contacted support I was told tickets can be of equal value in ANY section. My receipt clearly states section 204, and I received section 230. When I asked to speak to management I was hung up on. Same thing happened with chat. Very unprofessional and borderline scam. If you have to deal with Vivid Seats please be careful. They play by their own rules and have 0 customer service. Expensive lesson learned."
"Over a month ago, my fiance bought very expensive tickets for us to see ""Hamilton"" on January 1, 2019. It's January 2nd and we have YET to receive the tickets. We missed the show and we're out >$1300. Not only was Vivid Seats' customer service unresponsive to requests for assistance, review of the UPS shipment of the tickets reveals that they were NOT SHIPPED UNTIL 5 DAYS BEFORE THE SHOW. UPS attempted delivery twice, but required a signature, and as both of us work, we weren't home to provide the required signature. We tried working with UPS, but UPS was unable to allow us ANY ACCESS to the tickets. I have used Ticketmaster and StubHub for years without ANY difficulties, and I STRONGLY recommend avoiding Vivid Seats. I am deeply suspicious of fraud, but I not-so-patiently await receipt of the tickets before taking the next step."
We purchased Avalanche hockey tickets for a New Year's Eve game. The Vivid Seats website and the printed ticket stated a 7:00 pm start time. The game actually started at 6:00 pm. We did receive an email asking us to confirm that we had received our tickets. We hit confirm and sent it back. At the very bottom of that email was a 6:00 pm game start. We had to scroll way down to the end to see that and did not do so as we thought it was simply a confirmation that we had received our tickets. It said nothing about an error on the ticket or website about the start time of the game.
"Read their fine print before getting tickets from them. I thought the tickets I purchased were a fair price for the event considering the prices and seating they showed Actual 2 tickets I received were $45 face value each. Someone’s else’s name was on them, we paid $384 for these 2 tickets. They are just a broker to move tickets from other people who have them to sell and mark up the price to what they feel is in line. In line with what? Look elsewhere before inquiring about tickets from them."
"Please consider this experience before you use Vivid Seats. Our family had built plans around NYE this year is SF based on concert tix purchased from Vivid Seats. At 2 pm, the tickets had not arrived and our opportunity to get to SF and our pre concert dinner plans were lost. Vivid customer service recited their legal disclaimers to me and basically communicated that once they had my money and the tickets were on the way, they had no liability or interest in my personal situation or the plans that they had blown up. For a simple $200 they have lost a family of concert and sporting event buyers for the rest of our lifetimes... to me, that is the definition of ""worst customer service""."
"DO NOT EVERRRRRRR. Just do not. Don’t do it to yourself. I ordered the tickets in April, the Giants vs Cowboys game was December. This was a father’s day present for my dad and it was my first game, I was so excited. So the day comes for the tickets to arrive. They’re electronic and they send it via email and you have to “accept the transfer”. Ok well the email never came. So 5 days before the game I’m on the phone with customer service. "
I was worried after I bought the tickets as I checked feedback. ??? Tickets to Belk Bowl went all good and were mailed via UPS and had in hand before I left from Georgia. The ??? tickets to Charlotte Hornets were purchased the next day after I bought ??? on Dec 22nd. These were supposed to be emailed the 26th as the event was the 28th. I would later be told 27th and then 28th. I spoke with customer service on the the a.m of 28th as I was concerned about no tickets yet and event was that same day. I was told I would have them by 2 pm. To make a long story short got tickets at 443 pm and was able to print at hotel. It was very stressful. If I hadn’t planned on traveling anyway to NC from GA to attend the Belk Bowl for 29th it would have been even more stressful. At the end of the day all was good and enjoyed both events.
"Vivid Seats is misleading until you read the fine print. ""100% customer satisfaction guarantee"" only applies when a show is completely cancelled. Nothing is done for unhappy customers. There were still tickets available at the box office, yet they changed me nearly double what I would have paid directly. IT'S A SCAM!!! Do not EVER use Vivid Seats for anything. They are the worst I've dealt with."
Purchased tickets in November to the Peach Bowl on 12/29. Received email from Vivid Seats that my tickets were available to transfer however never received the ticket transfer email. The company is very hard to reach via phone if you have an issue and only can get a live person if you want to purchase tickets. Contacted them 4 days in a row and each time was told they are working on it and trying to contact the seller for my tickets and would let me know status. Never did they reach out to me on status. It was me calling them and they would never answer on how I could attend the event if I did not receive my tickets. In fact they stated it was my fault since the tickets were transferred to me. Their 100 percent buyer guarantee is false!! DO NOT BUY from this company!!!
"I purchased two tickets totaling $435 for my husband and son in June for the Denver Broncos vs Cleveland Browns game on 12/15/18. I received an email next day from Vivid Seats stating the seller has contacted them that the etickets will be delivered on 12/13/18. I never received the tickets or email of tickets. My husband and son flew to Denver and had to buy tickets at the stadium! Every time I called to complain or get an update they would hang up on me or tell me, ""Sometimes the seller sends them an hour before game time. Please be patient."" "
We ordered the tickets for Jeff Dunham 4 months early. We received an email saying we would get the tickets a week early for the event. We received a email 17 days ahead that said the tickets were coming from a 3rd party vendor and had to get their Mobile App. After doing this we then received an email that we would receive the tickets by the 24th. On the 25th I sent an email that we had not received the tickets yet. I was called by Vivid Seats on the 26th and asked if we would like an upgrade to Floor seating at no cost to us.
"I purchased 6 tickets through Vivid Seats 4 months prior to the Rams and Arizona game. Drove all the way to Arizona from Los Angeles and never received my email tickets. We got scammed for $600. I beg for everyone not to use them, customer service are paid to lie for their scamming."
"I ordered two tickets totaling $128.53. They never sent the tickets. They claimed they had. When I got to the event, hoping I could straighten this out. No such luck! So now I am out $200.53. Horrible!"
"Buyer beware. If you purchase tickets you cannot indicate if they are etickets, paper tickets or downloadable tickets. Your tickets will come (via emobile ticket) about a week before the event. You cannot resale, no refund and no transfer. DO NOT USE Vivid Seats."
"Worst experience. I purchased tickets from Vivid Seats. I picked a certain section and purchased 3 tickets. When I received my tickets they were in a completely different section on the other side of the stadium. They say they are comparable, but definitely are not. I say we start a class action against them. They sell one thing and they give you another."
I purchased tickets through Vivid Seats for the Las Vegas Bowl football game between Fresno State and Arizona State. My husband and our 3 daughters are Fresno State alumni. Vivid’s map showed which side of the stadium was for each team and I purchased accordingly. When we got to the stadium we realized our seats were on Arizona State’s side. There were 4 other Fresno State fans seated next to us. They had also purchased their tickets through Vivid and confirmed that Vivid’s website map said we were on Fresno State’s side. One of them had even called Vivid’s customer service and had it confirmed. Of course Vivid’s customer service denies their error and states in their email to me that the map showed that I was purchasing tickets for the Arizona State side. Will never use Vivid again.
"Worst Experience ever!!! There's no way to refund, resell or get tickets back if e-ticket got declined. There is some nebulous 3rd party that is actually the ticket holder and there is no way to contact them. Lost almost $300 on tickets. DON'T USE. Scam to get your money."
"I tried to purchase tickets through Vivid Seats for an event and after entering all information, the site said the seats were no longer available. I went to then purchase similar tickets on another site, only to be given a confirmation email from Vivid after purchase that the seats I had originally wanted were now purchased BY ME. So I am now in possession of two tickets I don't need and Vivid refused to take responsibility for their site saying that ticket purchase did not happen."
"I had a very similar problem as Christine (see Below). I went to purchase 4 tickets to the Women's National Soccer Team. The tickets were priced at $102, but my credit card was hit for $1,048. Vivid email Customer service has been no help and when I called their customer service number, I just sat on hold and no one ever picked up. I hung up after a 1/2 hour. Tom in NYC. ""I bought two musical tickets for 300 dollars from Vivid Seats, because it said 'mezzanine right', but it turned out 'upper right' tickets which cost 30 dollars. Oh my God! I complained about this, but the company said they're just intermediary! They can't tell me who's the seller. Then, who can take responsibility for this scam transaction!"""

"I ordered 2 seats for concert. Purchased in September, event was in December. Two days before the event, I received a phone call telling me the seats I paid for were not available. I was offered 2 other choices, neither option were seats that were as good as I originally ordered. These were a gift for my granddaughter. I had to call her and ask what she wanted to do. When I tried to call Vivid Seats back, it was a three ring circus trying to reach a human. They then screwed up sending the information to Ticket Master so I had to call them again. Four hours later, I finally got the tickets for the lousy seats sent to my granddaughter. Worse experience I have ever had buying tickets for an event. By the way, I am 75 years old! I have a LOT of experience buying event tickets. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE!"
"I purchased a ticket for Michelle Obama. After purchasing the ticket I was told that I had to use another app, Flash Seats, to retrieve the ticket. I have spent almost two hours trying to use this app. I have sent three emails to Flash Seats and also posted a message on their Facebook page, and still have not received a response. At this point, I'm thinking I just threw away $300 because the event is tomorrow and I can't get anyone to respond. I will NEVER use this company again!!! I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau as well."
"This company is a SCAM - DO NOT USE. They took my money and never gave me the tickets - claiming they had to reach out to some mysterious “seller” who never responded back. They took no accountability for ensuring I got the tickets they sold me, and their customer service manager was beyond rude. BEWARE."
"Don't know if this people are stupid, or just don't care or what? They have zero customer service. Bought tickets and it took 2 days to receive them. Before I got them I sent customer service an email and it a week to even get a reply. Called them and was on hold over an hour and no one even picked up. I will never ever use their service again. They suck."
"I purchased 3 tickets for my son and his 2 teenage sons to see Ozzy Osbourne while we vacationed in Las Vegas. Ozzy cancelled and I haven’t been successful in getting back $448 and Citi bank (they disputed for me) just informed me that I never will! This is a Rotten (to the core) company to do business with (I blame Ozzy, also). What started out as a kind deed turned sour fast. I Am Livid with Vivid!!!"
"My girlfriend bought tickets for a Thursday night to see the Weeks in Austin, we turned up to the event only to find out it had been canceled days before. Vivid did not provide any notice of the cancellation despite admitting they knew of this. When we asked for a refund they refused citing that the show had been rescheduled for Friday night. I pointed out that they already had a show scheduled for Friday night which we couldn't attend (thus the Thursday night tickets) and that Thursday night had not been rescheduled, just canceled. The lady on the phone said it didn't matter and they don't issue refunds. Long & short, do not book tickets with this company, they will take your money in bad faith and keep it for services not rendered."
"Vivid Seats makes a habit of horrendous customer service. In one experience, I forgot to include my apartment number in my address. The tickets were returned to Vivid Seats. When I called to have them re-send, they re-charged me nearly $30 to have the tickets overnighted. The concert was still weeks away, but Vivid Seats refused to ship the tickets using a non-overnight service. The best part: the tickets were never overnighted in the first instance; rather, I was simply charged an overnight fee."
"I bought tix to an out of town event. I had a family emergency the week of the event. The tix were for pick up at will call. I tried to reach someone on the phone and was unsuccessful, I email chatted a few people. They refuse to resell the tix because they were at will call. I tried to find every way to get a photo of the tix, etc, and they just kept telling me that I had to pick them up. I do not live in the city where the event is occurring. They included the wrong number for the emergency contact and then told me that was on purpose. I am out $700 and these tix were to a sold out show that I am certain someone else could have enjoyed. Customer service was rude and not helpful. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!"
My wife paid $440.00 for Ballet West in SLC Utah. They were face value $ 190.00. She was fooled by the placement of the ad that I blame primarily on Google for allowing marketing fees to override search parameters. My wife searched for “Capitol Theater seats”. Their website was about the seventh or eighth in line after all the scalper sites. I subsequently found infinitely better seats and at less money right on the theater site. She has received the tickets but they don’t look like the ones from the theater so we are afraid to resell them.
"I purchased two tickets and were sent to my email as a screenshot or image, when we wanted to enter at the event in Scotiabank Arena in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, they told us that those tickets were invalid. We called at that moment to VIVID SEATS service and they made us wait a long time saying they were investigating, finally we couldn’t get at the event, literally I was crying with anger. Obviously I will never buy from them again and you shouldn’t either. I would not recommend buying your ticket here. You can find many other alternatives quality ticket sellers online. Then, some days after I called them again to get my money back, and they have a terrible service. You cannot get a refund and they aren’t willing to make any exceptions."
Purchased two tickets and was charged a delivery fee (for electronic tickets) and a service fee that was more than half of the price of one ticket. You have to go digging to find any sort of price breakdown. I take responsibility for not catching these fees before submitting my order but they could do a much better job of clearly displaying these additions. I would not recommend buying your tickets here. You can find many other alternatives quality ticket sellers online that do not have outrageous and unnecessary fees. Also you cannot cancel the tickets or get a refund and they are not willing to make any exceptions. There is no reason whatsoever to order from this site.
"Like others, I did not review before entering their site and spending a half-hour searching for tickets before I was punched in the face with a $200 service fee for two tickets. VIVID must have to charge the 35% fees they do so they can afford to grease ESPN’s pockets. Why ESPN would link to a shady organization like this is hard to understand unless they are getting a huge cut from someone stupid enough to pay these usurious fees they tack on to the purchase price at the last second. You go to a future game on ESPN and click on the link, you end up at this boiler room outfit. How can these folks over at Vivid look at their selves in the mirror and feel pride? It’s hard to fathom. And how are payday loans regulated and not these outfit. Oh, and this outfit is rated 1 out of 5 stars on this site. That speaks for itself."
"I would just reiterate the numerous bad reviews of this company. First, the purchase: you select the tickets, and only after the purchase is made do they tell you how much more in ""service fees"". My price almost doubled for the tickets! Second, the tickets were not delivered as promised. When we called customer service (after an extended hold and having to speak to two people), they agreed to resend the tickets via email if we paid an ""added"" delivery charge of $25!! The rep ""Dargo"" should learn this is not the way to treat a customer. I will NEVER buy from them again. You shouldn't either."
I purchased two very expensive tickets for the Andrea Bocelli Concert December 2 2018 for $1901.24. Illness prevents us from attending this concert. I have tried to sell these tickets and I have tried to get a refund but to NO AVAIL. I WILL NEVER BUY TICKETS FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN.
"I purchased tickets from Vivid Seats, drove 3 hours to the game and found out that my tickets had been sold to another person 1 week prior. I’ve contacted Vivid Seats, went through all there procedures and still have not been refunded my money. When I call them, they put me to a Senior advisor (who will not give out their last name). They continue to tell me that they are still investigating. I asked to speak to their boss and they would not allow me to. When I called today, Adam senior advisor hung up on me. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
"Like other reviews of Vivid Seats on this website, I wish that I had done my usual research before buying tickets from this company. They are a complete ripoff, unethical and should be shut down. I was told tickets for an event were $32/seat, it was a comedian, and was charged $113/seat plus $57/seat in fees! It was not disclosed at the time of purchase and I was surprised when I got a confirmation email. When I printed out the tickets the face value showed $32!!! I filed a complaint with my credit card company and Vivid Seats replied with documentation that was printouts of their website THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN! It was blurry font and hard to read. They are obviously used to having to fight disputes. DON'T buy from them!!!"
"I really wish I had read the reviews of this company before purchasing. I have never encountered any US based company that operates this way. I purchased 2 tickets for $300, and learned only after purchasing that they would be delivered the DAY BEFORE THE CONCERT. They will not even confirm which seats I'll be getting. When contacting them I was hung up on twice. Be warned this company will never EVER issue you a refund. They flat out refused even though no tickets have been issued yet. Their solution for me is that I resell the tickets, when I asked how they suggest I do that since I don't have them, they hung up. Be careful, you guys."
"Do not buy from them. The website is rigged to charge you extremely high extra fees before you agree to them. Then their employees are trained to deny any returns or cancellations. Their answer is you agreed to charges via clicking on the ok tab. Wrong. ""I didn't agree to over 200.00 in extra anything."" Before you have a chance to see what your total is their site completes the transaction. It's FRAUD! The president of the company belongs in prison."
"Vivid Seats is a horrible company. False advertisement and I would like to see them shutting down their company. Please do not buy tickets from them. They were supposed to give us tickets to a concert 48 hours before. They failed to provide tickets. I called and waited for more than 10 hours over this 48 hours. At the end, they were afraid to answer my call and even blocked my call. I would be put on hold for 30 or 40 minute and when the phone started to ring and supposed to go to an rep, it automatically got hung up. It happened so many times until I realized it’s not an accident and they blocked me. I’m going to BBB now to file a complaint against them. I don’t want any other customer to go through the same ordeal as me."
"I didn't even want to give Vivid Seats one star! They deserve 0 stars or if even possible -5 stars. I bought tickets and they overpriced me without even telling me the price before I paid. When you try and contact customer service - first on their live chat via ""text message"" you have to go through multiple prompts to even get a person. When I asked for a refund of my money they wouldn't provide it for me. I asked to speak to a supervisor and they gave me a number. I spoke to the supervisor and he was horrible! Worse than the live chat. "
"Vivid Seats is a horrible business. I paid $500 a week ago for tickets to an NFL game and with the game starting in about 4 hours, they still have not produced my electronic tickets. They were promised to me 48 hours ago, which I was a little nervous about and for good reason. After numerous calls into them, emails and chat sessions for hours over the last 24 hours, still no tickets. They are a reseller and rely on other people wanting to sell their own tickets. So if the ticket holder happens to be not available, incapacitated, in jail for drunk driving or in the hospital, they can't provide Vivid Seats the ticket and I'm the one screwed. They say they guarantee tickets but if they are not in control, how do they guarantee them? Instead of being excited to go to the game, I've spend the last 24 hours pretty ** off! My suggestion while talking to them, give me 2 other tickets of equal value. You can probably guess the answer... ""No refunds, no exchanges!"""
"First off I cant believe Vivid Seats is still allowed to sell tickets to unsuspecting consumers!! My daughter and her friend bought floor tickets to see Travis Scott in concert in Toronto on Nov 21, 2018. We live 8 hours away. Tickets were to be picked up at (will call). They arrived in Toronto went to the venue to pick up tickets and they were not there. What a nightmare. She called Vivid Seats in a panic knowing the concert was in 3 hours and the arena had no tickets for sale. After being on her cell phone for 30 min Vivid Seats informed her that the seller never sent them!! They offered her upper bowl when she purchased floor seats. She was in such a state of stress not knowing what to do she said fine. They did not explain to her that if she agreed to the seats in the upper bowl she would not get a refund at all. She was afraid she wouldn't get in at all and didn't want to call back after thinking about it and have to wait another 30 min. Time was precious. "
"I mistakenly purchased tickets for a music event at the Ryman Theater in Nashville. (I thought I'd be there, but immediately realized after the purchase that I would not). I understood that they would not do refunds, and that I had to resell the tickets to get my money back. As I'm a rookie at this I thought that I only had the option to use Vivid Seats to sell them. (On the last day I was told that I can use any portal to sell them)."
"I have been a lifelong Philadelphia Eagles fan and purchased two tickets through Vivid Seats back in April 2018 for a once in lifetime experience to watch the team play in London, England on October 28th. At the time of the purchase, I received a confirmation email stating that the order was being processed and no further action was required. Leading up to the event, I planned a trip to London with my partner, booking both travel and lodging accommodations, all centered around the experience of watching the Eagles play in London. "
"It was my first (AND now LAST) time purchasing tickets with Vivid Seats. They were for a show at the Curran Theatre in SF. I chose my 2 tickets, created my account, inputted my credit card information and without any option for order confirmation, the order went through. I was very surprised by how much I was charged, an EXTRA $111. I expected a service fees but not this high! When I called customer service to ask what the fees were they told me I was charged service fee of $52 per ticket and $7.50 for delivery of electronic tickets!!!"
"I purchased two tickets and a parking pass for the Mavs game. I received an email that my tickets were cancelled. I contacted the customer service, I was told that they could not do business with me because my bank disputed prior fraudulent charges that was placed on my credit card. I tried to explained to her that I was not aware of my bank disputing any charges but she refused to listen. Please if you need to buy any sporting event ticket, look somewhere else because Vivid Seats will disappoint you. Please stay away from this company."
"I purchased tickets for a show in Austin TX—a live taping for the podcast “My Favorite Murder.” When we arrived, we were denied access made aware that the tickets were bogus. Fortunately, there were some last-minutes tickets released, so my daughter and I were able to the show. I called Vivid Tickets that night and was assured that if I filled out a form that they sent me I would be contacted by the company and my money credited. Guess what? I was double fooled. I did as instructed and waited a week to contact again when nothing was acknowledged. No response. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I’ve never had this happen before. This company ripped me off for over $600. I feel like a fool."
Ordered tickets to an NCAA basketball game. When I arrived at the arena I was informed the tickets were for wheelchair attendees only. I am not in a wheelchair and did not request wheelchair accessible seating. They refused to refund tickets I could not use and for which I received no value. This is a disreputable and unethical company that in no way honors its stated commitment to customer satisfaction. Do not waste your hard earned money buying tickets from Vividseats.com!
"The seller screwed up and sent the wrong tickets 2 days before the event even though I paid in full 2 months before the event. I knew they screwed up, Vivid knew it too but Vivid also allows the seller to correct their mistake up until 1 hr before the event... Their policy is ridiculous! When someone pays the tickets always should be sent immediately. I then did all the work to try and get the proper tickets. Countless times I called and online chatted with Vivid but again a crappy policy states the seller is given until 1hr prior to correct their mistake (or so I was told). "
"We bought the wrong day for tickets, realized it literally 1 minute later, and have tried for 2 hours to get someone on the phone or in chat (with the chat window saying ""Connected. Please wait to be attended."", for 2hrs now, without a single representative ""attending"" to me""... great customer service), with no luck on either account. Finally, I pressed a button saying I wanted to buy tickets, now of course when they see a phone call that would result in money, now they finally take my call. Well, they've told me that all sales are final. Well, they shouldn't be. When someone makes a purchase, and realized 60 seconds later they bought the wrong time or date for an event, the consumer should be able to cancel the purchase. "
I will NEVER buy from Vivid again - bought tickets in July and 2 days before the concert this Friday they canceled my order/ticket. They said the seller couldn't provide - that is A JOKE!!! So will they tell my daughter that she has no ticket for a concert that she has been looking forward to for over 5 months??? Then when you try to call you cannot get in touch with a person. They just send you through various menus then disconnect you. I am furious with this company. And will do my best to tell everyone NOT to do business with them EVER. AWFUL.
Shipped Parking Pass to wrong address and won’t reimburse me. Went back and forth with customer service for 5 days and still got no satisfaction. They delivered to Staten Island NY when they were supposed to deliver to Del Ray Florida. They were told from the start I needed in my possession by end of day Thursday. Said they would send to Florida but it arrived in NY on Friday after I had already left for Florida. They are refusing to reimburse me for the additional shipping costs incurred and for the time I spent trying to resolve this over a 5 day period.
"If I could give zero stars I would. Bought tickets from this site, and when I went to resell them, they do not support listing the ticket format that they provided to me upon purchase. Who in the world does that? I mean, this is a first in my lifetime. And YOU WILL NOT GET ANY ASSISTANCE ON CUSTOMER SERVICE. This place is a sham. I am honestly afraid to use or sell the tickets I have purchased from them... I doubt they are real after reading all of the other reviews here."
"Purchased NHL ticket, the event is tomorrow. Still not received the tickets and customer service cannot help, they make you wait on hold several hours and nothing happens. This site is not serious. No tickets, no refund."
"Would give zero stars if I could. I don’t understand how they’re still in business. My husband bought tickets for my daughter for a 21 Pilots concert in Dallas on 11.07, only to discover that the seats had already been sold, so he was basically holding bogus tickets. The employees of the American Airlines Center said this happens all the time with Vivid and there was nothing they could do to help. After waiting on hold for an hour, my husband reached a Vivid employee by phone, who seemed under the influence of something and proceeded to put him back on hold and then hung up. We are disputing this charge with the credit company but don’t understand why they haven’t been brought up on some kind of fraud charges."
"Looking for low cost tickets to a college non-conference basketball game for a team my son was interested in for 5 people. Purchased some for $9 each, and with fees and finance charges, they ended up being about $14 each. This was still less or comparable to other ticket sites. But it seems shady to not be upfront with these fees/additional expenses."
"We purchased 4 tickets on the Vivid Seats website. There was a glitch when ordering and my wife got a notice that the tickets did not go through. She then retried to purchase 4 tickets. Later she saw her credit card statement and was charged for 8 tickets. Later the concert was rescheduled, but the tickets cannot be resold. Basically we lost over $1,200.00 on 8 tickets for a concert that we cannot even go to. And of course talking to Vivid Seats is a total waste of time as the fine-print on their website absolves them of any issues. Please note these guys are just glorified ticket scalpers that are out to make a quick buck and pass issues on to others. Avoid at all cost!"
"My child got a hold of my card, totally unauthorized purchase. I didn’t even know it had happened until I received an email about the tickets. I immediately looked at my bank statement and called Vivid Seats to cancel the transaction. They refused. I called my bank who filed a dispute... and now I wait. The transaction is still pending. I had never heard of this company, but a $685 charge is a big deal and they were 100% unhelpful."
Please check Ticketmaster or any other ticket website before purchasing from here. I guarantee you will find cheaper prices for the exact same tickets! They will not refund a penny if you purchase from them and find them cheaper afterwards.
"2 tickets for Ariana Grande in CT... Listed at $330 a piece. Christmas gift for my daughter so although a little steep I was ok with the price. Purchased the tickets and was charged $850.92! $7.50 to email them to me and the rest in service charges. Give me an ** break. I should’ve known that something was up when the fees weren’t disclosed beforehand. But damn! How are they legally allowed to get away with this? Of course, no refunds period. I’m so disappointed. I hope no one else falls for their scam. Buyers please beware."
"I purchased 11 tickets for a NFL game for my family. 2 days before event, they had still not arrived. I contacted customer service who was no help at all. I started live chats and got no response. I called the customer service line and after painfully long hold times, and communication challenges with the agents, they could do nothing... said they would contact the seller to further investigate, but could not guarantee the tickets coming at all, let alone on time. They also refused to refund my money if I didn't receive the tickets on time either. I spoke with a supervisor, who was also useless. Worst experience ever for ticket purchase. Do not trust this site and never buy from them."
"I bought 2 SJ Sharks hockey tickets which specifically said I would receive a ""transfer notification email"". I did receive a confusing ad-like email ""this email is not your ticket, the tickets are almost yours, click accept tickets to seal the deal"". I never did since I had already purchased them but was just waiting for the transfer email. Weeks went by without notice, and now 2 days before event, no tickets. Rep said I was sent email weeks ago but nothing. Very poor method to deliver product. The last time I ordered ticket was with StubHub, and 1-2-3, I got them in a jiffy, confirmed the same day."
"I paid $800 for 3 tickets to Ed Sheeran, and Vivid Seats claimed that I had already received and verified the tickets through my email, but I never received them. When confronted numerous times to get the issue resolved, they kept saying they would ""investigate"" the situation, and told us that we would not be able to get the tickets before the show. I will NEVER buy from them again. Complete and utter scam even though they promise a 100 % guarantee. DO NOT USE THIS SITE!!!"
Vivid Seats charges a 30% service fee to buyers PLUS a shipping fee (Even when your tickets are delivered electronically). Plus they charge the seller a fee. No other ticket reselling site has fees that high. Should've used StubHub or Ticketmaster. Will never use them again.
"I bought 4 tickets to a hockey game through the Vivid Seats app the day before the game. I received an email shortly after stating that my tickets will be transferred to me electronically and that I had to accept them. After a few hours go by I still did not receive my tickets to the game. I tried contacting Vivid Seats through the phone number that was provided in the app but got nothing but automated responses. I then tried using the ""Chat Now"" feature through the app and the same thing, automated responses. I then tried sending them an email through the app and was told someone would be contacting me shortly."
"I was unable to access my tickets. I believe I have went through the steps unless I accidentally deleted the ticket transfer email, because the app says they have been delivered. I even received a text this morning saying they have been delivered. I have sent several emails inquiring about my upcoming event and the only response I got was how to go through the steps. I tried the chat live and it's been over an hour and still waiting. I don't understand why there is so many hoops to jump through. This is ridiculous and will never use again."
"Vivid Seats should not sell concert tickets that they do not completely have ownership of. Instead, they sell tickets that others can cancel, deface, or discard. Should place a disclaimer upon ticket purchase of possibility of similar outcomes as what took place in my situation. Got to the venue and was told the tickets were fraudulent. ""Sold to me then canceled by seller"" is what I was told by venue employees. My 14yr. Old daughter waited all year for this concert, we bought it 2 months in advance. I should have went somewhere trustworthy!"
"I purchased 4 tickets to the first game of the World Series. The $700 tickets became $1000 per ticket after ""service fees."" I received a ""view from the seats"" which showed an unobstructed view. When we sat down we had a large pole right in front of us meaning 2 of us could not see the batter and the other 2 had to lean over to see him!! Very dissatisfied, will never use Vivid Seats again!"
"The ticket price says $153 but there are hidden fees that are designed to be overlooked or hidden until it's too late. Do not be fooled, the ticket price you see is not even close to what you will be billed! Also there is the worry that you may not even see the tickets as so many others have stated. I paid a $50 markup on a $150 ticket. I normally check reviews before making online purchases but this time I didn't. This company is basically a online ticket scalper."
"We bought 4 concert tickets through Vivid Seats for $800! We tried to go to the concert. We were an hour early and the traffic was bad understandably. We could not even get to the venue not even close to the venue. We waited in line for an hour and a half and didn’t even move! The concert was oversold! Finally after missing the first band and the beginning of the main show we had to leave, I could see hundreds of cars waiting in the same line missing the show. "
I bought Ed Sheeran tickets for 468 dollars. Drove almost 6 hours to find out they rescheduled to the next day. I can't take work off with only just finding out today. They won't refund me. So if I somehow don't find a buyer. I'll have to be out not only a concert but 468 dollars plus the gas and hotel purchased for nothing. Do not buy tickets from this company. Worst experience ever.
"Bought e-tickets to a recent NFL game. On the day of the event, the tickets still had not arrived. Contacted customer service four times (three times on the chat, once at the phone) until an email was finally send. The email arrived after the event had already started. Additionally, the link to the tickets in the email did not work. By that time, the event was basically over, and not worth attending anymore. Contacted customer service through chat again and explained the problem. The agent claimed that they did everything correctly and basically blamed all fault on the seller. Asked for a refund but this was rejected based on the claim that they did everything correctly. TLDR: won't buy again from this company. Multiple customer service requests required to receive tickets. Tickets arrived too late to attend the event."
"Bought 2 tickets to Oakland Seattle Game August for game on 10/14/18 in London for my son and I. First of all always call Vivid Ticket sales number so you get someone on the phone - Their Customer Service Department sucks big time. After Ordering noticed they said tickets would not be available until 7 days before the event - as we were flying to London on the 13th I called to see when I could get my Tickets as I wanted them in hand. Well no luck on this. They first said the tickets would be overnighted to me at no cost, then changed their mind and said the Tickets would be available at the main Will Call Window at Wembley Stadium."
"Purchased 2 very expensive VIP concert tickets in late July for an event on October 19th. Tickets were expected to be electronically transferred on October 15th. The tickets were not transferred on this date so I reached out to the online chat on October 16th and did not have any issues getting a hold of a representative. The rep told me that he sees that I have not been transferred the tickets and he would contact the appropriate department, further explaining that I would receive the tickets soon. I checked online and my delivery date for the tickets was adjusted to October 16th. Well, the next day (October 17th), I still had not received my tickets so I reach out again to the online chat on explaining that I've already spoken to a rep but wanted an update. Online customer service explained that they are having trouble getting in contact with the seller. "
"This entire operation is designed to scam you. They screw you out of your money. You are not assured of the tickets... even though they hold your money. I would never advise anyone to use this service. They are a bunch of crooks. I purchased tickets in advance and was told they would arrive the day before the event. It's **, no tickets, no customer service, just stealing your money."
"This was the most stressful, frustrating and unprofessional experience I have ever had in my life. My tickets were ordered on Monday and were stated to be available Thursday for our game on Saturday. They were e-tickets... first of all, why should it take 3 days to receive an email with a barcode? Second, they never came Thursday and I had to spend LITERALLY hours Friday trying to get a hold of a person (instead of listening to automated responses) to find out if I was going to receive my tickets in time. The only way to speak to a human being is to buy something from them so I entered the purchase option in the phone list and had them transfer me to customer service from there."
"We purchased 3 tickets for Ed Sheeran in MN in October of 2017 for his concert scheduled for October 20th of 2018. The confirmation stated the tickets would be available via an email a minimum of 3 days before the event. We were not able to access the QR code and the US Bank ticket office could not help us, even with proof of purchase and a confirmation number because we purchased tickets through a 3rd party vendor. We call Vivid and we were on the phone, either speaking with someone or on hold, for over 1 hour. "
"In my previous review, I expressed my frustration with Vivid Seats over an unjust circumstance. While it took some time to get to the bottom of the issue, they did refund my ticket price and gave me a fair discount. As a result, I have decided to remain a customer. The only reason I gave them a 4 star review was due to the length of time it took to resolve this matter."
"When I purchased the tickets for my event the date for email stated I would receive the tickets at least 4 days before the event. Then 7 days before the event, they updated the delivery to one day before the event and told me to go print at FedEx while on my vacation in downtown Chicago. ""Unfortunately we can't reimburse you for the cost of printing, it costs 10 or 20 cents to print a document out at FedEx."" Never mind the cost of the Uber, and most importantly the inconvenience and my time on a vacation. I won't be using them again."
"Bought tickets for 60 dollars each and ended up paying 80 dollars per ticket with a sneaky service fees that they place out of the blue and the final price is only shown once, and quickly before you confirm the purchase. There are a no refund policy as well. I would never buy tickets there again unless you want to spend an extra sneaky 1\3 in every ticket you buy."
"I've worked with at least a dozen ticket retailers and Vivid is the worst. Virtually no service -- almost impossible to reach representatives by phone, email or chat. They pay through PayPal, which can be a challenge obtaining funds. I currently have a $323 payment refunded to Vivid by PayPal. I'll chalk it up to the cost of Internet sales -- a lesson to deal only with StubHub or local companies in the future."
Writing this review in 2018 - I purchased tickets for ACL from Vivid Seats during the month of July (concert in October). I received 2 confirmation emails immediately after purchase; one with my receipt and one with information on how I will be contacted to receive my tickets. The email with information about receiving my tickets stated that I would either be contacted by someone about where to pick up the tickets or I would be able to pick up my tickets from the will-call window at the ACL event if I did not hear from anyone.
"I purchased tickets classified as ZONE SEATING, paid a premium, and received tickets NOWHERE NEAR where advertised. Customer service is VERY DIFFICULT to reach. I have spent hours talking to 4-5 people. NONE of what they promised (emails, refunds, return calls) were ever received. After being told the tickets I received would be offered at a lower cost, with money refunded to me, days passed before being told they are still working on this and it will take a few days to determine if, where, how, and when they would reissue tickets, where they would be located and when/how much I may possibly be refunded. I will NEVER use Vivid Seats again. I cannot recommend them to anyone. HORRIBLE. UNETHICAL."
I was purchasing Rose Garden tickets for the Veuve Clicquot polo classic. I had 2 options. Rose Garden VIP and Rose Garden General admission. I paid more for VIP. I knew from attending last year that VIP was extra from Rose Garden. The tickets I received were Rose Garden General admission and not VIP. They will not refund any of the money for the difference which is $300. Do not purchase tickets as they mislabel to charge more money.
"I purchased tickets for an NFL game and paid a total of $365 for two seats. Problem is, the tickets never arrived. I sat on hold for a total of two hours prior to the event trying to find out what the issue was. They put me on hold again for another hour. I have spent the last week waiting for them to finish an “investigation” of the issue. I want my money back because they never held up their side of the bargain. They basically stole my money. It has been a week of calls and being placed on hold and being told, “You should hear back tomorrow.” Do yourself a favor, DO NOT buy tickets from them. They are completely unreliable. Their customer service sucks. They promise a buyer guarantee, but the only thing they are guaranteed to do is steal your money. Thieves! I had to warn you so you don’t make the same mistake I did! Save your money and your time dealing with these idiots!!!"
"Legal scamming should not be allowed, purchased tickets for 3 times their value, with no way to tell until printing them. Customer service is as good as the site. Sad story, I am disputing the transaction with my bank directly."
"I bought 2 tickets to a Washington Caps game over 2 weeks before the event. Received an email 2 minutes after the purchase asking me to ""Accept"" or ""Decline"" the tickets. I realized the tickets were in the wrong section so I declined the tickets and went online and bought 2 more in the correct section within 10 minutes of the original purchase."
"We purchased two tickets to Sting/Shaggy in San Francisco, which was postponed immediately before the concert. We are from out of town, so were already out the expense of hotel, etc. New date TBD, if we cannot make it, we must sell tickets ourselves. NO refunds from Vivid Seats. The service and help around this is very bad!"
"I purchased 3 tickets @ $499 a piece for the Nebraska vs Colorado football game. I studied the sections of the stadium as I had a clear understanding of where I wanted to sit, on the Nebraska sideline, with no obstructions from overhangs or pillars blocking our view. The Vivid Seats website provided a real life view of the field from each of the seats they offered."
"Buyer beware! I paid over $300 for 3 seats to a Journey/Def Leppard concert when we got to what were supposed to be seats, it as just a coral were a bunch have to stand for the whole show. I emailed them of my complaint, they tell me that have called me, cell phones don't lie if no one calls. I ended up calling them, they didn't seem to care and finally hung up on me with nothing getting resolved. I'm done buying tickets from them and if they are the only ones tickets, then I don't need to go!!!"
"I sold 2 VIP tickets to Nitro Circus for exactly the amount I bought them for plus the added 10% fee that Vivid Seats charges for selling on their site, total of $204. The event was Oct. 3. Today, Oct. 7, I received an email stating that they are now recouping their $204 plus an additional $100 because I did not ""fulfill the order"" - they stated I only submitted one ticket. The PDF I uploaded included 2 separate tickets and was 2 pages long, one ticket per page. Vivid Seats somehow separated the pages and only forwarded one ticket to the buyer - they claimed the PDF was only a 1 page document. I am not even sure that I believe them. I am suspicious they are double dipping and that the buyer paid for them and actually got the 2 tickets plus they are falsely claiming I didn't submit both tickets and are backcharging me. "
I purchased tickets from this company at 66.00 each. When I received tickets they where 39.50 each and my total charge was 359.00. This company over charged me almost 200.00 extra and it is false advertisement when a company gives you one price on the site and then the tickets come and they are a completely different price!!!
"They charged me $180 for 2 tickets to a concert with the tickets valued at $45 a piece. That means they charged me double? The fees are outrageous. It's robbery. I did see the show. But tickets at the door were $45. Please stop stealing money from people. Especially as a business. I wish I would have seen the terrible reviews before letting you take my money. At this point 101, 1 star reviews and 8, 5 star reviews. People don't lie."
"I purchase 4 tickets for $438.62 through Vivid seats and the concert was cancelled by the fire department at the beginning of the concert. The promoter advised us to call the merchant that we bought the tickets from to get a refund. I called the next day and talked to a manager. I explained the issue. So the manager whose name I think was Margaret put me on hold to verify the information with her crew. She came back on the phone and said that she was advised that there was a interruption that evening however she didn't have all the details. Which is understandable. That was on Saturday September 29, 2018. Here it is getting ready to be October 4th and still no response. "
This company doesn't care about anything but taking your money. Customer service is a joke. Fees are outrageous and make sure you look at the WHOLE page closely. The site is designed to keep you scrolling down to complete your transaction not to look at the whole page to see the fees they charge. I will never use this company again and no one should ever either.
"Vivid only deals in electronic transactions, which are easy to do and easy to undo. Yet they refuse to cancel a transaction siting ""their policy"". A game was re-scheduled, not their fault but also not my fault. They refused to accommodate me in any way. If I wanted tickets for a Monday night, why would I order tickets for a Friday night? They have my $446 and I have nothing. They delivered e-mails and could easily cancel the transaction, but they chose not to take consideration of their client. I would never do any business with them. The money and the hour I spent on the phone are enough to make me tell everyone how awful they are. They are totally one-sided in their customer relations. Take your money and provide nothing. Outrageous and greedy. Their policy is senseless."
"While on vacation I purchased 4 very expensive tickets ($1,600 total) months in-advance and was advised after purchase that tickets had to be delivered via overnight or mail vs sending them to me electronically even though I had requested at time of purchase to have electronic delivery (and that was listed as an option). Vivid then sent tickets without consultation and they were returned as we were on vacation. Vivid now charging $25 to have tickets sent again. The kicker is that I was on hold twice for over 30 minutes twice trying to get the tickets sent. No one answering phones and so called ""live online service"" did not get a response either. Vivid makes it easy to get your money and are the worst at customer service or showing up once you have paid and they have your money. WARNING>>> DO NOT USE VIVID AS THEY ARE AWFUL!"
"I paid $480 for 2 tickets for Bruno Mars @ the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on what I believed to be the T-Mobile Arena website. The venue's website directed me to Vivid seats (I had to open an account), from Vivid my tickets were transferred to Flash seats (I had to open an account as well). While my tickets were in my Flash seats account my tickets were transferred into someone else's Flash seats account, when I asked who transferred my tickets no one could give me a straight answer even though I could see on my account who's account my tickets were transferred into. I figured if I could see the full name, e-mail address & phone number of the person of the Flash seats account my tickets were transferred into why couldn't Flash seats ask the person how they acquired my tickets?? "
"I learned about a concert late in the day and bought tickets online from Vivid Seats. I opted for ""electronic delivery"" (Their term) and received a receipt and two promotional emails, but no tickets. An hour before show time I called customer service and was told they could re-send the email but they had to printed -- that was not ""electronic delivery"". At 8 PM in downtown Boston I was not willing to wander around on the off chance of finding a printer open, so I requested a refund and was refused. Today, 48 hours after buying the tickets, I still don't have another email from them. Buyer Beware!"
"This was my first experience using Vivid Seats and my absolute last time. I have never been more frustrated by a customer service “team.” Let me start by saying, I purchased tickets on Thursday, September 27th to be overnighted to my mom’s house and arrive on Friday, September 28th. Vivid Seats specifically says on their website and via text, “All tickets are guaranteed to be delivered in time for your event, and you will receive a tracking number via email once the order has shipped.”"
Got tickets in April for a September show. They sold them twice. Couldn’t use tickets. Lost 500 bucks. We had to spend almost 400 bucks at the venue. Scam for sure. Don’t do it. Will file a complaint with the state attorney general.
"I missed the timeline on Ticketmaster and seats were sold out for the Seeger concert. I had a friend's recommendation as his hockey tickets went smooth so when I accepted the face value from Vivid I naively thought they included fees. Keep in mind I was told they were reputable. They charged me 123.00 additional service fee. 11.95 delivery For electronic email!!! I missed this, still don’t know how at payment. I understand it was in a box somewhere on the page. Missing the public sale by 1 hour and using this site cost me additional 335.00. They could’ve cared less when I asked to cancel order after I got my confirmation. I hope at least the tickets are valid."
"The customer service today was absolutely terrible. Talked to 3 different representatives today, and was on the phone for 3-4 hours after my mom had been online chatting with the term all morning (multiple times over several hours). Was told ""The tickets have been delivered/sent. It's no longer our problem."" (We did NOT have the tickets. Had to contact a third party to verify the that. An entirely different process.) The first told me that after a certain time period I could get a refund (which in my mind is a start, but doesn't make up for not getting the tickets and all the frustration my family went through today). BUT was then informed by the second representative that 1) no he did not say that (he did) and 2) that I will not be getting a refund and there is nothing they could do."
"100% buyer guarantee is a scam - I purchased 2 tickets on Sept. 5 from Vivid Seats for the Green Bay Packers-Washington Redskins game on Sept. 23. $597. I was told my tickets for would be emailed by Sept. 21 and that I needed to be at my desktop computer to download. I called multiple times and told them that I needed to travel to get to the game and asked for an earlier delivery. They said it was up to the seller, but promised the tickets would be delivered by Sept. 21. After they didn't show up by that date, I called again on Sept. 22 to say that, to cancel, and request a refund. They said that as long as the tickets are delivered by 1 hour before game time, the refund doesn't apply. "
Parking pass was listed as a different location than what it actually was. Vivid Seats would not refund or exchange my purchase. They apparently do not validate the things that are listed on their site.
"I live in Nebraska, and purchased tickets for the Ozzy farewell concert in Tinley Park, Illinois. I later, read the reviews for Vivid Seats, and my heart stopped! I had my wife, 4 children, and grandson looking forward to this concert 600 miles away, and I didn't know if we could even get in. I kept my worries to myself, and when they scanned my ticket at the concert, the scanner lit up green, and we all saw an amazing concert! Thank you V.S.!!!"
This site allows the Sellers to list the tickets any way they want - they can put incorrect/fraudulent information on them to get people to click on them and buy them. I am now out $288 for fraudulently described tickets. DON'T USE THIS SITE! Secondary sellers like StubHub don't allow this type of activity. I can't even believe Vivid Seats can get away with this type of practice and has not been shut down yet.
I purchased concert tickets on Vivid Seats. When I arrived at the venue they told me my tickets were not valid. Apparently Vivid Seats sold the same tickets twice (they are a third party seller). I tried calling Vivid Seats and was put on hold for over an hour. I did not make it into the concert and spent $200 on the tickets. They told me they would look further into the situation. I have not heard from Vivid Seats nor can I get ahold of them... Each time I call I am on hold for over an hour. I will NEVER buy Vivid Seats again.
Before you use this company keep in mind that there is no guarantee that you will get in. My ticket didn't scan and due to the fact that they were a third party seller they would not accept this invalid ticket that was sold to me by VIVID SEATS. They will keep you waiting on hold for at least 30 minutes to an hour. My phone call lasted over an hour. It will be three to five days before I even find out if I'll get my money refunded.
On 9-16 I purchased tickets for the Jets Colts game scheduled for 10-14-18. I received the confirm of the tickets except the confirm said I would receive the tickets 3-2-2019. That is almost 5 months after the event. I immediately responded to have this corrected. I also commenced a live chat to do the same. The live chat did not work. I called and emailed and attempted to chat for 6 days. I called my ccard and asked them to not accept the transaction. They said they can't. I called for 2 plus hours today to finally get someone on the phone after waiting on hold forever. They said it is a no cancellation policy and basically I was out. If you use this site you are crazy. They admitted to receiving my emails but again no cancellation. Do not use this site.
"I purchased tickets for a Phillies game on WEDNESDAY September 19th specifically because it was the only day I didn't have class or work. When I went to print my tickets the morning of the game I saw that they were for the Tuesday night before. When I called customer service to explain that I would not have ordered tickets for a Tuesday night the original representative just said ""hold on"" and put me on hold for about 15 minutes (the total call was 18 minutes and 18 seconds). "
"I ordered tickets for Keith Urban concert in Eugene Oregon for September 27th thru Vivid Seats. I thought I was going through a company with a solid reputation as their website popped up when I tried to purchase the tickets directly From Mathew Knight Arena. I ordered and paid an arm and leg through Vivid thinking I had purchased great seats, but the minute I submitted, I decided to cancel and go to directly to Matthew Knight Area. I called them back within 4 minutes to cancel and was told, ""Too bad. So sad"" and that I was stuck with my order."
"We bought tickets using Vivid Seats and the event offered general admission tickets for $38 but we were presented an offer to pay over $220 per ticket for a reserved seat. So we spent $456 for two tickets which included all of the fees as opposed to paying $76 for two tickets because we were guaranteed seats. In fact, the tickets that were sent to us showed a row and seat numbers but when we arrived at the venue they said it truly was general admission and while they had reserve seating we did not have tickets for reserved seating. We called and spoke to James and he basically said we must have ‘misread’ the disclaimer and the tickets. Again, keep in mind the tickets reference a row and seat numbers but we paid $456 for what we could have paid $76 to have the same location at the concert."
I went online trying to save money for parking tickets at SunTrust Park rather than paying for parking at the park. Which I should have done. Using this website I paid twice as much for parking ahead of time that I would have paid once I arrive to the game. They might as well be scalping tickets.
I have twice contacted customer service about my negative experience & have not received a response from them. I experienced significant issues with my tickets and am extremely disappointed with my Vivid Seats experience. I purchased these tickets the afternoon of 9/7 for a 2pm showing of Hamilton on 9/8. I worked w/ a CS rep to explore all of the options for delivery of these tickets as it was approximately 24 hours before the event. I spent an hour purchasing these tickets as I had major concerns about whether the tickets would actually make it to me on time (they were only paper tickets) as I was also traveling into NYC just to see this show. 
"On August 30th, 2018 I purchased 2 tickets for a concert from the online company 'Vivid Seats' that was going to take place on September 1st. I paid $182.62 for the tickets. The tickets were already outrageously priced as the face value for the tickets were $32 to $42 but we decided to pay more for good seats. I was e-mailed a copy of our tickets on the date of purchase and the printed tickets were the only way to enter the show. In the Vivid Seats e-mail I received, the company stated ""Your eTickets must be printed to guarantee entry to your event."" and ""The venue where your event is taking place typically does not allow eTickets to be scanned from a mobile device and cannot print tickets on your behalf."""
"Customer service is the worst. Please take my word. Do not do any business with this company. And tell everyone you know or come in contact with, they are a rip-off, in my opinion. And from what I have read no one has a different idea of them. I only wish I had checked on them before I had any dealings with them."
"TOTAL SCAM. Spent $1,700 on tickets that were never delivered to my e-mail. Called customer service 10x and they insisted they were sent but refused to provide actual proof and were unhelpful and rude. Wouldn't provide a refund and money completely gone to waste. There's a reason there is a class action lawsuit against this JOKE of a ""company""."
"I paid a lot for tickets, never received them. Asked for my money back and was told I need to wait 5 business days for an investigation to be completed and I might get my money back. No customer service."
"I paid $1228 for 2 tickets to Dave Matthews Band, I purchased seats Section D and when the tickets arrived, it was in a different section. They refused to help me out. This isn't the first time this happened. They claim, in the fine print I knew what I was getting into. Never again!"
"Ticket order ** purchased on Aug 31st was never transferred to me. My purchase was a 4:00 Sept 1st baseball NYY vs Det in NY. I live in NJ. Was supposed to receive transfer email within 24 hrs. I call Vivid 3x on Sat. Did not get transfer email till 3:24 pm on Sat. Could not attend game and they refuse me a refund. Screenshots below show initial receipt of purchase confirmation and the actual time they sent me the tickets. Horrible customer service experience. Was lied to by 2 reps, spent a cumulative time frame of 3 hrs trying to get my tickets. To top it off today I had an SR Customer Care rep tell me it's not their concern about my travel arrangements. "
"An absolute joke of a firm. They up-charge an unacceptable amount in exchange for sub-par service. I bought 2 tickets to the Yankee Game last night and the tickets did not transfer properly into the ""app"". I spoke to Vivid Seats customer service 4 times yesterday and was told to take a screenshot of what I was seeing in the app and send it to them and they would get back to me in 45 mins - 1hr. I sent them 2 emails and never heard from them. After I called again I was told that I would be called directly - never was. The money left my bank account very, very quickly but acquiring the tickets was a real hassle and my wife and I missed the event. Each ticket was $21 and the total cost was $60 - that is almost a 50% service fee for absurdly unacceptable service. Will never use again and will advise every single person in my network to stay away. Good PR Vivid Seats!"
"I bought two tickets just the other day. I was told each ticket was $60, but then I got charged two fees. My total came to $189. When the tickets arrived a few days later, I saw the tickets were only $35 each. I checked it against Ticket Master pricing. For the tickets and shipping, it was only $109. I could’ve got parking and still have been way under $189."
"My wife ordered two tickets back in April (Order# **). The tickets were never delivered. Everytime we call, wait time was long, and the custom service just resent the same email to us (not the ticket transfer email). When we ask Vivid Seats to resend the ticket transfer email, the CS always says it is up to the seller to send it. In the end we did not receive the tickets, and missed the event. And WORST thing is Vivid Seats refused to fully refund, insist the seller has sent us the ticket transfer email. Worst experience ever. Should have just used Ticketmaster."
"I am absolutely livid about the bait and switch when I picked up my tickets for Pearl Jam. I paid $822.29 with the service fee and was told I was upgraded to a club box with a much better view. When we arrived to these seats, not only were they behind the batting screen which was annoying, but the stage view was almost completely obstructed by the sound and lighting deck. The only performer we were able to view was the drummer and had to watch the entire concert on the jumbotron screens as the entire stadium was sold out. The next day on Vivid Seats website/app, these similar seats we sat in went for $160 less per ticket than what I paid for my original confirmed seats 4 months ahead of time."
"Misleading, wrongful sale, or resale of tickets. They said we were purchasing e tickets, and never got them, when we tried their app, their app was not functioning properly, so then they said we had to print them, seems like bait and switch to me, not to mention the insanely high markup and service fees. Will never use them again."
"No accountability. Paid big $$$$ for event tickets and parking - tickets were left on doorstep exposed to rain, etc. Parking passes sent electronically, unable to retrieve. Did I mention poor customer service and support - Buyer Beware. Their services are not worth the hassle. Very, very disappointed."
"I purchased 3rd base line tickets for a pirate game to take a friend to baseball game. I checked the app to make sure the tickets were available before I left for the game. When I was at the entrance gate the app would come up on my phone, but had an error message when I tried to go to ""my ticket"" section of the app to show the tickets. 3 times while at the gate I kept getting this error response try again. Embraced and getting remarks from the people behind me in line waiting I got out of line and purchased another set of tickets from the box office. It was the 3rd inning before we got to our outfield seats as the game was sold out and outfield was the only tickets available. "
"Like others have reported, Vivid Seats stated that an email was sent to us by the seller for us to claim or accept the tickets. We have not been able to locate such an email and have asked to have it resent. Vivid Seats have stated that the seller will not resend despite the fact that the tickets have not been accepted or claimed by us and there is nothing they can do. Huge mistake not looking at reviews before buying through Vivid Seats as this is not uncommon. We are now out $750.00 as Vivid Seats state they are unable to do anything because they show the seller sent an email. So many other reputable ticket agencies out there. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."
I purchased two tickets for a concert and selected the wrong date. My BAD! I contacted them immediately and was told they can't change my purchase but I can resell them on their site for a commission. I posted the tickets for sale understanding that the sale would cost me over $100 in fees. I received a notification that my posted tickets for sale would expire. I went on the site and updated my registration. Still I heard nothing about anyone wanting to purchase. Now a week before the concert I have reduced the price to far less than I paid and decided to go on their site as a 'purchaser.'
My daughter received her Lalapalozza 2018 ticket which turns out is a wristband that my ten-year-old thought was really cool and she put it on. Turns out it does not come off easily. We watched YouTube. We tried for 40 minutes to get it off but not destroy it. So we called after a 40-minute phone call. They said tough luck nothing we can do. I offered to pay out of my pocket to overnight it to them if they would just let me cut this off her. Send me a new one and I will pay overnight shipment too you know. They really can't help. You'll have to send your 10 year old daughter or just lose the $220.
I purchased a ticket for Vans Warped Tour in Columbia on Sunday for over 132.61 at Vivid Seats to have a good Spot. What I got when I printed the ticket on the link that Vivid send was a 50$ general admission ticket from Ticketfly. That’s fraud in my book. Will never use them again.
"We ordered tickets to the Man City Bayern Munich match and never received an email that tickets were delivered. We called 3x, twice hung up on/disconnected, live chatted 2x and Vivid claims an email was sent. Gave an alternate email at 5 pm and at 11 pm no response. Live chatted again and Vivid says they emailed seller and for us to just wait. After reading these reviews we did a charge back and would highly recommend never using Vivid. Oh BTW, the tic were allegedly delivered via Ticketmaster, just better off going to Ticketmaster to begin with. Don’t use Vivid ever."
"Tickets were purchased for 7/22/18 Foo Fighters concert in 11/17. These were purchased by my daughter as a Christmas present for me. It was also a Birthday present for my friend whose birthday is 7/23. $411 was spent on the purchase. At NO TIME was any mention made of an obstructed view. When we arrived at Field Box 5 we discovered there was a big ugly yellow post obstructing my friend's view. I called immediately. I was put on hold multiple times. Call was “disconnected” at least twice. I was told I needed to send them a photo and there wasn’t anything they could do to rectify the situation at that time either. I missed the first 4 songs of the set, and then there is no place to upload a photo at support@vividseats.com!!! Worst experience ever! I urge people not to use this service. They do NOT care about the experience of the ticket purchaser. Go to LiveNation or Ticketmaster instead."
"My girlfriend and I bought tickets on March 21st, 2018 for Dave Matthews Band's Toronto performance on July 10th (almost 4 months in advance), which was my dream concert for more than a decade, so I bought tickets by paying $446.46 to be able to see them close from in front of the stage. Our excitement lasted until they scanned our ticket at the day of the concert. The tickets were scam. I spent about an hour on the phone to be able to get a customer representative (dropped from line twice meanwhile) and in the end they sent me a ticket which was far from the stage and when we were in the arena Dave Matthews Band was already playing their songs for about an hour."
"I purchase WWE tickets through Vivid Seats. On their website it did not state the event name only that the tickets were WWE so I purchased them for my sister birthday present because she loves wrestling. But came to find out that they weren't raw or smackdown but nxt ticket. So I called Vivid seats to ask about getting an exchange but they stated they don't refund or do exchanges. Lol. I paid over 400.00 for these tickets. But they didn't care. They basically told me to scalp my tickets. I thought scalping was illegal!!! And would I even get the same amount, WTF. I will NEVER order from VIVID SEATS AGAIN... THEY DON'T DO REFUNDS OR EVEN EXCHANGES."
"I purchased tickets for a concert through Vivid Seats. Without asking, they switched my seats to a less desirable location in the venue. They would not exchange or refund the changed purchase. I spoke with a senior manager and she said she could not help me. I purchased price of two tickets was $267 each 3 month before the event, and now the price is $150 each!! They offer no refund no exchange!! Please purchase your ticket from somewhere else!!"
"My wife purchased two tickets to a major league baseball game for me as a Father's Day Gift. The original purchased price of the tickets was $50 each or a total of $100. My wife unfortunately purchased the tickets through Vivid Seats and not directly with the team/stadium. Instead of paying $100 for the tickets, she paid $171.92 or an additional $71.92. "
"I purchased tickets for a concert through Vivid Seats. Without asking, they switched my seats to a less desirable location in the venue. They would not exchange or refund the changed purchase. I spoke with a senior manager and she said she could not help me."
"VIVID SEATS hereinafter called here as ""seller"", didn't delivered to me, product that advertised. Seller is deemed as scam or fraudulent because didn't honor the electronic business transaction offered. When me and my wife arrived to the HOLLYWOOD BOWL, I just stood as a fool there because I couldn't pick up nothing. I spent time, money, gas, effort, trust to arrive the place, and nothing appear under a ""supposed order number **"". I contact repeatedly the seller until 8:30pm. The event started at 7:30pm, and the representative only told me that they can not honor the ticket because it was reselled to a third party who will request my ID. WHEN I showed my ID, NOTHING APPEARED under my order number or ID. I miss the half of the concert at the Hollywood Bowl, and I had to rebuy another tickets SO MUCH EXPENSIVE with a reseller... Complete scam and fraud!"
"I'm so frustrated with Vivid Seats. I purchased tickets for my family of 5 to attend our 3 children's 1st concert make in March. The concert was June 27th. I called on June 26th because I hadn't gotten the tickets yet and you said, don't worry, the ""company"" has until 24 hours prior to send you your tickets. You'll get them. Then I saw the next morning I still didn't have them. So I spent another significant amount of time and called again, this time they said the ""company"" releasing the seats didn't open till 9. They would call me back by 9:30 once they open to find out where my tickets were. I waited till 9:45 then called again because I didn't get a call back as promised. "
I purchases 2 tickets to Sam Smith in Boston for 6/26/18 back in December of 2017. This was a Christmas/Birthday present for my son. As the date approached we never received the paper tickets in the mail. After a few calls they sent an digital replacement via smartphone. When my son and his guest arrived at the event they were denied access. After a few more calls they were allowed in and got to their seats. During the show two other parties showed up with the actual printed tickets. My son was forced to move to another row behind what I paid for. He spent a portion of the show on the phone with Vivid trying to resolve this. This company shouldn't be allowed to operate in this business and I'm going to demand my money back!
"Stay away! Vivid Seats is highly deceptive. I bought two tickets for an event at the Santa Fe Opera and the site told me the price was $160 per ticket. I pushed the ""buy"" button and was told the price was $420, not $320. They then asked for my satisfaction in the transaction and when I rated it ""very dissatisfied"" they said they would contact me to find out why. They did not. I canceled the charge with my credit card. This company should be banned from the internet."
"I do not recommend using vivid seats. They don’t care about their customers and just want your money...not to mention the outstanding fees they apply. Not going to go into great detail. They are not trustworthy and hide behind technicalities instead of honesty. Just wish I would’ve read all of the reviews on this site before I tried. Live and learn. Honestly, don’t use these guys."
"UPS attempted to deliver the tickets three days prior to the event. They sent it back to the shipping hub. I requested that UPS send it to the nearest UPS store. Someone at the store signed for the tickets, but the envelope was lost. The tracking number showed delivered. I kept hounding UPS to sort it out. Vivid tickets will not refund or do any sort of compensation since the tracking on the UPS website says delivered. I will never use them again. I had to buy my tickets from Ticketmaster so my girlfriend and I would not miss the concert."
"My daughter bought concert tickets in May from this site only to know right afterwards that Vivid Seats didn't even have the tickets yet, of course my credit card was charged right away and I was told tickets could be delivered as late as one day before the concert. The problem is, we live in Ohio and the concert is in LA, in September. This is fraud, stay away from Vivid Seats."
"This company is selling tickets that do not exist. the seller did not own the tickets when they sell them. We purchased 2 international soccer game tickets more than 3 months ahead and tried to secure the tickets because they advertised that they are the official resell company. We chose the ""E-mail Delivery"" because we want to get the tickets right away. AFTER placed the order, I received the email stating that the tickets will not be delivered until 3 days before the game!!! "
"Please do not use this company. I was sincerely disappointed that there are going to be zero accommodations for an issue I had in receiving my concert tickets that were $116. I will never be using Vivid Seats service again. This is a scam company. They shouldn't make their customers jump through hoops to get their tickets. I was directed to download three different apps (Vivid Seats, AXS, and Flash Seats) in order to get tickets which didn't even work at the door to the venue. The barcode I received through the AXS app ended up being bad tickets because they said the tickets were a picture. Then as I tried to reach Flash Seats to obtain them, the app wouldn't even let me log into my existing account, or create a new ID. This shouldn't be a confusing process and it's poor customer service to say it was my fault for not setting it up properly."
"Did not research this company. Should have done so. But just trying to purchase tickets for family. Purchased tickets over the phone for 2 tickets to Anita Baker concert at Ravinia 6/10/2018. Was informed there were lawn seats available. Requested two tickets. Price was 156.37... first robbery!!! Normally they are 38.00 with 3-6 dollar convenience charge. I was informed over the phone I could pick them up at the venue, and would receive an email as to the exact location where to pick them up. By the time we arrived at the venue I received word, my family could not make it in... disappointing, but could not be helped. I was also informed when I initially purchased the tickets I could receive a refund, if the tickets were not retrieved by the start of the show."
Stay as far away from this unethical business as possible. They charge $60 service fee per ticket but you are unable to find that cost until after you purchase. They also will not refund for any reason. So many other reputable ticket agencies out there. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
"I wish I had read the reviews about Vivid Seats before my ticket purchase. I purchased 2 tickets for a Doobie Bros concert in Missoula Montana for over $400 and was assigned seats, which did not exist, and found when I arrived at the event it was General Admission and the seats actually cost $67. I called Vivid Seats and they would not refund me the extremely high price I paid for tickets compared to the actual cost of tickets. DO NOT buy from Vivid Seats, you will save yourself some anger. I have purchased tickets online many times from other ticket outlets and never had any trouble until I tried Vivid Seats."
"We bought 3 lower level tickets to the NBA finals. We arranged flights, hotel, travel, etc. We got to the game and the ticket office said our tickets were not valid for entrance and they had already been used. How can a company sell tickets that will not let us enter the game. We called Vivid Seats about this right away and was on hold for over 45 minutes waiting for a manager. We finally hung up the phone so we could see some of the game. I would never recommend using this company ever."
"I recently purchased tickets from Vivid Seats for the Soul2Soul, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw Concert in Eugene, OR. I purchased tickets thru Vividseats for $127.00 each. I was interested in purchasing more and found out the price for the same exact ticket is $47.00. I contacted Vividseats and there is nothing they can do. I will never purchase tickets thru Vividseats again. I feel they are participating in scalping which should be illegal."
"This whole venue is practically empty. I was promised best seat. I got seat 30, all the way at the end. They don't tell you what seat prior to buying it. They tack on extra fees as well. Horrible experience. I will dispute with my credit card company."
I purchased 1 ticket for an event from Vivid Seats which was confirmed on the final checkout page for $28 - I was then charged $38.98 through paypal. I contacted Vivid Seats and they asserted that I was made aware of the extra fees on the checkout page - but I am 100% sure that I was not. The show is not sold out and I checked the primary reseller before checking out - tickets were available there for the same price - but since I had already begun checkout process I stupidly went with Vivid Seats. I wish I hadn't.
"Always went through the big fellows before, but thought I'd try VIVID SEATS. Price didn't seem bad for an Elvis Costello concert coupled with Willie Nelson. Arrived at the venue, entered, and only then learned that Elvis Costello had stepped away from the engagement nearly a month BEFORE we had ordered our tickets (yet VIVID SEATS did not remove his name from the bill). To top all off, sat through the entire event waiting for Willie Nelson to only take the stage and angrily throw his hat into the crowd, then leave without performing. Neither Costello nor Nelson performed, and VIVID SEATS refused to refund our money, nor did they offer anything, even minimal, as concession. I wish I had read the reviews concerning VIVID SEATS on Consumer Affairs, before laying out so much money for worthless tickets/customer service. Two adages: ""Buyer Beware"" and ""Live and Learn""."
"My daughter bought 2 tickets for Bon Jovi for my birthday, paid a total of 267$, even paid for the express UPS delivery. The tickets were then delivered by email and when we received them they are marked for 44.25$ each. We contacted Vivid Seats and they refunded the extra UPS delivery charge but that's it. So including fees we were charged about 170$ over the value of the tickets. Will never buy from that site again!"
I bought tickets on this site which were priced at $90 each. I bought 4 tickets and paid $471 for the tickets plus taxes and admin. When I received the tickets they were priced at $50 each. This means the tickets were close to double before taxes and admin costs. I called to inquire why there is such a discrepancy. The lady said the tickets are not refundable but I can put them back on their site for resale. Maybe in the meantime I can purchase cheaper tickets. This is disappointing and the customer service is very unhelpful. Will never buy from here and will never recommend this site to anyone.
I went to Vivid Seats website and purchase 4 tickets for Chayanne (Sep. 13 2018). I choose 57.00 each. So total 283. I thought that it was fair. I received the tickets and they are printed for 39.00 e/a plus 6.00 on fees. I call them to ask them why. The customer service do not let me talk. She told me it was not refund and she hang out me the phone. I will never going to buy tickets on this website at all. Sorry my English is not very good yet!
"Best advice I can give you is to NEVER, EVER buy from or sell with this company. I am just about to start an open investigation with them and am discussing with two law firms on a class action against this company after I narrowed it down from five that were already interested. At least they will feel the wrath of the PR when it's in the news about their company, even if nothing comes of it."
I bought 2 tickets for James Taylor. The price was $52.00 each. They charged me $140.00. They do not display their fees anywhere just at check out. They do display very well if you want to add a insurance but they do not display the fee anywhere. They just charge more at check out. I went to their website to chat with them and John told me that they can't give me refund. If I knew about the fee I would have never bought these tickets. This is illegal. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM.
"Vivid Seats is Trash. I bought some tickets for the new Kevin Hart show coming to Houston in October, and with no previous knowledge of issues, they automatically cancelled my 6-ticket purchases saying they cannot serve customers with “recent transaction issues”... Humbly speaking, money is not an issue for me, so this was from left-field, not expected, and ridiculous I was not informed of an issue. This could have been a situation of identity theft, but as I said, no prior notice."
Purchased two tickets to Stagecoach and was told I was paying face value for the tickets. Just got the credit card statement and they added on a $179 service fee that was never discussed or disclosed anywhere on the website. This is the worst kind of service. It should be mandatory to show all fees and have them explained to you. Hidden fees in this day and age is disgusting. Wish I had read all the negative reviews on this company. They need to be investigated.
"Your company should be absolutely ashamed to take money, send out a successful confirmation and then 2 days later say we're going to refund it because we found a review I had written online that was negative from a previous experience. Consumers are suppose to write about their experience, not suffer repercussions and be bullied online. Plus at your request I took the review down last year. Better Business Bureau does not agree with these tactics. Wonder if these artists know about your antics??"
"I purchased 4 tickets for Kevin Hart show in August, boy was I ripped off in fees after now looking at other tickets sellers. I thought I was getting a decent deal when the tickets were only $118 each and after all fees etc I paid $592. Lesson learned and just wanted to warn everyone else not to purchase tickets from Vivid Seats!"
"Made this account just to warn people away from Vivid. They tried to hit me with a 40$ (!!!) per ticket service fee AND - get this - an 8$ download fee to print your own tickets. Is this what we've come to? I found the EXACT same tickets on another site in twenty seconds without a single hidden fee. Seriously, same tickets, nearly 50 dollars less per ticket than Vivid. This isn't the 1980's when there was sort of an effort on Ticketmaster's part to facilitate ticket sales - Stubhub poisoned the well and now we're stuck dealing with greasy re-sellers and their nasty websites. I really wish box offices would assign a name to a ticket like airlines do with a no-transfer policy. So tired of events being sold out THE SECOND they go on sale compelling you to dive into the swamp of re-sellers. But I do it all the time, and have to say Vivid is one of the absolute worst."
"I purchased 2 tickets to the Lightning/Bruin game yesterday through Vivid Seats. My credit card was immediately charged $309.58. I then received numerous emails from 3 different ticket companies asking to accept or decline the offer. I panicked and declined the tickets not knowing what was going on. I immediately called Vivid Seats and explained my situation and they said, ""No problem we will contact the owner and have him send them again."" Well, that never happened. I followed up with 3 more phone calls and they assured me that I would receive my tickets. Well the game came and went and I wound up with no tickets and no refund as they stated that all sales are final. Big rip off, no help, false promises. ""DO NOT USE THEM""."
"I was purchasing tickets for an event on Friday. While doing so, I received a promotional email for $50 off that directed me back to what appeared to be the same page that I was reviewing. However, the date had changed. I purchased tickets, called immediately when I received the confirmation for the wrong date. Essentially was told, ""Too bad -- all sales are final."" I got spanked for more than $900. BEWARE. DECEPTIVE PRACTICES. Pure bait and switch scam."
Wanted to buy event tickets and went to Vivid Seats website. I found 4 tickets and ordered them on what they called the electronic ticket site. I received an email confirmation on 8 tickets which I declined understanding my order had not been fulfilled correctly. I purchased 4 other tickets and received an email and confirmed the order. All of this taking place within 48 hours of the event. The following morning I called Customer Service and after explaining my situation was quickly transferred to a manager. I was told they would contact the original seller who sent the wrong number of tickets about canceling the order and that they would assist in selling them. I asked to be contacted regarding their success. Of course none of that happened and all Vivid Seats says is all sales are final.
Bought 2 tickets to the Bruins Game 5 May 6th 2018... Tickets were $210.00 a piece. At check out I saw my total was $564.00. When they called to verify I ask why was I charged so much? Oh because there is an automatic $100.00 service fee they don't bother to tell you about nor is it anywhere on the website for you to read! So you're forced to pay $100.00 and you don't know it until you actually ask??? Um yeah. I will never recommend using these people!
I attempted to buy concert tickets from these people. I got all the way through the process and paid for the tickets. Shortly thereafter I receive an email from them saying that my order was cancelled as I had previously not satisfactorily paid or followed through with a previous order from them or another entity like them. I have no idea what they were talking about as I have never done this. I have now put Vivid Seats on my blacklist. I will never order from them again.
"Went to attend the Kings vs Golden Knights hockey game and purchased 3 tickets from Vivid Seats. Received a confirmation email from Vivid tickets had been sent to my account and tediously downloaded another app, Flash Seats, to access the tickets. Was able to access the tickets early in the day before the event, however when I arrived to the event the tickets vanished from the Flash Seats app but I still had a receipt for the tickets from Vivid which Staples would not honor and told me to call them to get it worked out. I immediately called Vivid customer service and was passed around between several reps and put on hold for 5-10 mins each time before finally speaking to a ""manager"". "
"I will never purchase tickets with Vivid Seats. I purchased 2 tickets to Lady Gaga over 700.00. I was informed by email that I had to meet at a specific location for these tickets thinking Vivid is a big company and they do this all the time that the location was at a hotel lobby. Never said, ""Call when you get there"" or ""I'll be meeting you from my car."" Nothing like that. We were to meet between 4:30 and 7:30. We arrived at approximately 5:00 pm and my husband went into hotel to ask where we should go to get our tickets and they said they have nothing to do with Vivid Seats so then he asked the Bell Hop man and he said any tickets are usually at Will Call inside the building. We parked our car and sat across the street waiting for the doors of the arena to open. "
"I purchased tickets to a concert back in December for a 3:00 show and was in a little bit of a rush to do so. Not realizing instead of purchasing 2 tickets, I accidentally purchased 4 by mistake. Realizing this, I immediately called Vivid Seats and explained the situation. Their response to me was, ""All sales are final. No refunds."" I asked to speak to a manager and again explained the situation, to no prevail. I then contacted my credit card company and explained the situation to them as well, and they immediately disputed the charge for me. Then found out after a few months I had to pay the charge for the 2 extra tickets, that were never used and there was plenty of extra seats not filled at the concert. That's the price you pay for making a mistake. After this experience I will never use Vivid Seats again, and I strongly recommend you buy tickets from a reputable source."
I bought tickets from Vividseats.com for a concert in another state. When we arrived at the concert we were told our tickets were sold to someone else so we were unable to see the concert. FRAUDULENT!
I ordered tickets for a two day event from two different sellers 5 weeks prior to the event. I was given an expected ship date. The seller was able to change the expected date a date before the tickets were supposed to ship. I was given a new delivery date and upgraded to overnight shipping. I received word on the expected delivery date that they would be delayed another day. All Vivid would do was defend themselves and the seller. When all sales are final you have zero recourse.
Purchased tickets (Pink at MSG) in section 227 which is just off center stage. Received tickets in section 212 on side of the stage. The answer they gave was they upgraded me because now I would be sitting closer to the stage. And the fees are ridiculous. Such crap. I will never use them again. Buyer beware.
I ordered seats to surprise my boyfriend for April 26. I double checked and make sure I was ordering right tickets. I put my payment info and clicked continue. When it confirmed my purchase it said it was for Apr 25 not Apr 26. I now have tickets that I cannot use and lost almost $200 'cause they said they cannot change them. It was not my fault. I am even sketchy about selling them on there 'cause they want my credit card info to sell them. NO WAY will I use this company again.
I tried ordering 3 tickets to the AMA Supercross race. It never came. Asked me to confirm what I was ordering before I put my credit card info in. Next thing I know I get an email stating I ordered 4 tickets instead of 3 in a section not anywhere close to where I wanted to sit. Of course the tickets they gave me were more expensive. When I looked again I didn't see the tickets I supposedly ordered. When I looked at that section the tickets were less than half of what they charged me for them. They insist this is my fault. Why would I pay more than double for seats. They have some scam going on here. I would never use them again.
"I ordered Reds Opening Day tickets for 600.00. The game was changed for unknown reason to another day that I could not make. Vivid Seats gave many different reasons why they would not refund either a credit, refund payment, or give a different game. The tickets do NOT say they are not refundable, but I was told I should have gone to the website to read their policies. It doesn't say to go to the website. Apparently I should ""have just done that"" before I ordered them. "
I ordered tickets to the NCAA tournament - Paid a little over $550. Event was scheduled for Sunday 3/25/18. I was contacted by Vivid Seats explaining there was a problem with my order due to the fact that UPS does not offer Sat delivery in my area. They changed the shipping address to a UPS drop off center. The seller shipped the tix and delivery was refused at the UPS drop off point due to the fact that the drop off center does not just accept random deliveries to people and you must be enrolled in a special program. You would think Vivid Seats would be aware of the problem. Vivid Seats contacted me to ensured my tickets were now available for pick up. Went to the UPS drop off center - they were NOT there. 
"Beware of the ticket fees on this site. They are buried off to the side while you are creating an account, and look like an ad. There is no reconfirmation of the price or total to authorize before you hit buy. I tried to call customer service, but no help there. They walked me through the process, and showed me what I had missed, and it is my fault for not seeing it, but not obvious at all. Bad enough to pay mark ups on the tickets, but $70 in fees on $220 worth of tickets is crazy."
"Throughout the order process the tix I was purchasing were listed as ATL United vs NYC FC on 4/15. I was purchasing these tix as a surprise for my husband's birthday and planned to take family & friends to tailgate, celebrate his birthday and watch the game. The confirmation email I received stated that my tix would arrive on 5/7. Due to ticket arrival after date of game, I was prompted to look again at the tix I purchased. That's when I learned that at some point the tickets I thought I was purchasing switched to a different game. "
Went to Cactus League and referred to their site. Checked on tickets for game Cleveland vs Diamondbacks. Looked like there were few alternatives and limited sections where seats were available. When I went to make a purchase they told me those seats were gone. None left at that rate move up to $32 seats and made purchase. When I paid by credit card bill came back at $255 for 6 tickets rather than $192. Called them after making the transaction to complain and asked for cancellation. They refused saying their policy as indicated was no refunds. Since then I went to the MLB site and there appears to be no shortage of tickets.
"Not only do they sneak horrible fees in and make it seem like ""electronic transfer"" is an immediate ticket. **It's not.** I won't get my tickets until 2 days before the event (making it pretty impossible get my friends to buy the other 3 tickets from me since I don't actually have tickets). They will sell you seats that don't exist!!! Just told a friend where I'm sitting and guess what? That section doesn't have a row 30!!! It only goes to 28!!! 1st time on this site and NEVER GOING TO BUY FROM THEM AGAIN. I wish someone had warned me!!! I'm warning you!!! Impossible to refund!?! What did I buy?! And now cannot get a human being in the phone!"
"Vivid Seats sold me 4 tickets to my family for 3/14/18 basketball game at Oracle Arena. Immediately called them to confirm the event and seats, however they then advised they are STANDING ONLY tickets they sold me. BEWARE of this deceptive company, they falsely advertise and lure the public to purchase seats to a basketball event. I asked to pay more to get SEATS for my family, I cannot have my nephews standing for HOURS at a basketball game, they declined. They would not switch out my tickets even when I offered to pay more. DO NOT GO TO THIS WEBSITE. Now that I have shared this HORRIBLE experience with friends and family, I have now found this happens often. I am still disputing this charge of more than $1,000 with my Credit Company."
I went to vividseats.com and booked AUGUST 9/2018 concert tickets for PORTLAND OREGON for Hall and Oates. I paid for them and when my receipt came through minutes later it said my tickets were for a May 4/20187 concert in SAN JOSE California! I did NOT book a May 4 concert and that particular concert date is 2 web pages away from the August 9 date so you can't even click on it by accident. They don't care and would do nothing even though I called them 3 minutes later. It's their system mistake and I will be spreading the word about them far and wide.
My son and I made the mistake of buying tickets on this site rather than shopping around as we were trying to hurry in order to not get caught purchasing them as a surprise for my husband’s birthday. The tickets were DOUBLE that from Ticketmaster. No refunds. No exchanges. Sites like this should be illegal. If you are inexperienced with buying tickets... they will RIP you off. Terrible. Beware! They have no conscience.
This company is a complete scam and they admitted it. I ordered tickets and they sent me the wrong ones. I am out $220 now! They said that I can resell them if I want. The tickets that I wanted are worth that amount. The tickets they gave me are worth ten dollars a piece! They refused to refund or exchange and said that’s their policy!!! They gave me the wrong tickets!!! They ripped me off and took my money and now I can resell worthless tickets and maybe get $20 back? Really? I will never deal with this company or their worthless customer service scam artists again.
"I recently went online to purchase tickets for the Pink concert set for May 18, 2018. Tickets I selected were $657.67 each, total of $1315.34. When it was time to pay for the tickets, it showed that the cost was $1315.34. I was then directed to provide my credit card number and information to complete the purchase; which I did. I received a confirmation email indicating I had purchased two tickets as requested. I download the e-ticket and there was no information on either the email provided nor the tickets regarding the price paid. When reviewing my credit card statement, I discovered that I had been charged $1673.10 for the two tickets. This was actually $357.76 more than the amount I was initially provided for the price of the tickets."
"Ordered tickets for an event in another city I was going to visit. they said they wouldn't be available till the day before the event. This was too close for comfort so I tried to get help reselling them. They have a ""chat"" which just turned into them sending me more stuff to read. An actual person said they couldn't help me. Their site is not user-friendly. I have resold seats on both StubHub and SeatGeek with no problems. I've decided not to use them again."
"I purchased tickets to Disney on Ice through Vivid Seats and was tricked into purchasing completely overpriced tickets. I was asked how many tickets I wanted and put in 3. At the end it said $63.00. Then it asked me for my information which I put in, including my credit card information. I hit the ok button after I entered my information expecting a total amount and a confirmation option, instead it had confirmed an amount of $242.00 without my authorization. I then panicked and tried to rectify the situation with a consult from Vivid Seats explaining that I never authorized this amount. "
BEWARE! We purchased two concert tickets for around $270 each. The additional markup/service fee was around $80 per ticket. This amount was not easily apparent on the checkout screen. It was only when I checked my email and card statement that I learned of the additional charges. I attempted to cancel the order (like within 5 minutes) but was told no. It's a bait and switch operation. I will never purchase tickets through this site again. BEWARE.
"I was attempting to purchase 1 ticket for a concert event in Los Angeles. During confirmation process, for one reason or another, the 1 ticket changed to 3 and I accepted. After seeing my receipt reflecting a $1750 charge versus the expected $450. I immediately (within 5 minutes) called the company to request two of the tickets be cancelled. Vivid Seats indicated they would not refund the money even in light of the facts, I notified them within 5 minutes of the error and 9 months before the scheduled event. Perfect example of a company that does not value a long term relationship with its customer base in order to make a quick buck. I will never do business with this company again, lots of other options out there, and let anyone and everyone know about how dissatisfied I am with Vivid Seats."
I purchased 3 tickets to see The Lion King in July of 2017. The show was scheduled for Dec. 2017. The price I paid for the tickets and what I bought the tickets for were two different prices. I disputed the difference with Vivid Seats and with my credit card company. The dispute was settled in the favor of Vivid Seats. I wasn't happy about it but learned my lesson to be very careful when buying tickets through a third party. We had been planning on seeing this show for 6 months and it was a very special occasion. My daughter was had turned 13 on the day of the show. 
"We purchased tickets, received receipt which we have for row 15 on the wall at TD Garden. Vivid seats sent us worse tickets, and would not honor tickets we had on our receipt. This should be illegal, these were for my kids for Xmas, they now put my kids in seats where their view is obstructed. They state they can change your tickets as they see fit if they seem it ok because you check the I agree box. I would suggest you use any other company but these liars. I will take pictures with my family at the game and post how they stuck us in worse seats and we will continue our internet campaign to warn as many loyal fans we can. Vivid should not be allowed to ruin other kids Christmas as they have done to my kids, who have looked forward to the seats we had paid for and now do not have. Stay away from Vivid tickets. They are not to be trusted."
"I have used Vivid Seats only for purchasing tickets. It could be a little bit harder to do it. I cannot find immediately what I am looking for. Basically they are intermediary between buyers and sellers of tickets. I had have some negative experience with them, for example if I buy a ticket, and after the purchase I made mistake in date. I have the next period of 10-15 minutes to allow me to change it or refund it."
"At Vivid Seats, I'm able to search and find what I am looking for and do it from the comfort of my own home. I like the convenience of looking for tickets without having to look all over, without having to go and stand in line and when at the sporting event you can already have the tickets when you get there. However, I feel that they need to have more pick up options or the options to print them out without them charging a fee to do that. You shop online for the convenience of not having to leave your home so you shouldn't be penalized for it."
"On the website the features I like the most are the VIP and the limited features. They are great for people that are loyal to their website giving them the fastest access to all the greatest events in and out of the area. The seats and ticket prices are great and all events I am looking for. They have great customers service. On the other hand, I remember a while back when I started using the site they had a slight bug where you would purchase tickets and not have access right away to them like you should. Few hours and the bug was fixed immediately. "
"I first searched most ticket sites and found that Vivid Seats was the cheapest. The overall ticket purchasing process was average. I made an account, activated it, and bought the tickets. Vivid Seats has a wide range of tickets. It is easy to find what I want within a short amount of time. I used it to sell some extra tickets before and I bought some when a concert was sold out. However, the UI needs improvement and the search bar is too specific and doesn't recognize a search if you barely misspell a word in it. Another cool feature would be to compare with other ticket sites to ease the research required to find the cheapest price."
I have use Vivid Seats to purchase ticket to a football game here in Tennessee. It was a game that I really wanted to see and I had tried a couple of other sites and I couldn't find anything or they were just too much. A friend told me about Vivid Seats. When I first used the site I made an account. The layout is very easy and intuitive to use. I found everything that I was looking for in no time and I would definitely go back and get tickets on here in the future if I needed them. It was a pleasant experience.
I feel like Vivid Seats is one of the up-and-coming ticketing websites/service for popular venues across the United States. I made an account and linked it to my primary email address. This made it easiest for me so that I could keep track of my ticketing purchases. Navigation of the site was simple and easy. I like how easy it is to find tickets for various venues. I also like how trustworthy the site is. The only thing I dislike is the fees that are associated with purchases. I often forget about them until I am buying the tickets at the checkout process. I wish that they would find a way to offer more promotional discounts and lower prices.
"I like vivid Seats' low fees and tickets where you can not get much anywhere else. On the other hand they need to add some more to it than what was given in the way, as well as how they need to put more seats that make it easier to understand and make it more well known. They also need it to be better looking. I have had a account for this site but I have use others that makes me not use this one as much anymore. How it has something more to offer than most than others. It needs to be more clear and more telling on how to use things from others."
I enjoy everything about Vivid Seats. I appreciate the company and what it has to offer. I made an account and like the quick and easy access. On the other hand I would make tickets available for print and it would be nice if they offered discounts or incentives. Other than that it is a great site which offers great incentives. I am always pleased with my purchase. I would recommend them to a friend and family member.
"It was a good experience with Vivid Seats. I went to the website and searched for the event I wanted. It came up easily, and when I clicked into the event I had the option to navigate by either price or seat location and I like that. I could easily navigate the site and it allows me to focus on where I want to be for the show or event rather than having to scroll through cheap seats. But the checkout process was standard and could be more efficient. It always feels like it takes forever to check out on these types of sites. It would be nice if they had you create an account first so you don't have to re-type your name and address during checkout."
I googled the tickets and clicked on the website. I chose my seats and then paid for them. I didn't have to pay to make an account with this website which I really enjoyed. The tickets were easy to pay for and I trusted the website with my payment information. It is user friendly and loads quickly. I enjoyed using this website compared to other websites that do similar things because this website was very easy to use. If I was confused about a certain part I used the help option. It is sometimes difficult to see vacant seats. This was the only feature that I was having difficulties with. Some of the seats should vacant one minute and then the next it would be taken.
"It's a pretty easy site to use with the events I want. All of the seats I was able to obtain were amazing and weren't offered at any other site. I simply looked up the event I wanted to go see then I selected the type of seat I wanted and clicked purchased where I proceeded to make an account. I made an account before purchasing so that I would have a profile for future purchases. I was happy I was able to attend the event that I wanted to go to. All the other sites did not have tickets for the event that I wanted to attend. But I would like there to be more events/tickets available. It would also be nice if the payment system was streamlined, other than that I like Vivid Seats the way it is. It's a perfectly functioning system that provides the customer with what he wants."
"Decent, would buy from again - The features in the website looked nice and thought out. Although I did have a lot of redirecting problems so I was sure if it was just the website or my internet. It was awful. It took me over an hour to order 2 tickets. Everytime I was almost done it'd close out and start all over again. It was easy to find everything you were looking for on the site, though. You could even see upcoming events and such which was pretty interesting. The payment was simple just like every other website. But the whole redirecting thing had me stressed out."
I made an account so I could be notified about available tickets for a sold out concert I'm looking for tickets too. At this point I've just used it for research but will definitely use to purchase if tickets come up in my price range. I really like the ease of the map feature when searching for tickets and the color coding system so you know exactly where the seats are that you're looking for.
The Vivid Seats website is very easy to navigate. I was trying to secure the right seats for an upcoming football game and realized that I needed more info and some help. I called the Vivid Seats' number and made contact. The representative was very informative about the seating situation in the arena and he explained to me what would be the best ticket for me. I was trying to secure the right seats for an upcoming football game and I realized that needed more info and some help. I called the Vivid Seats number and made contact. He was very professional and courteous and helped me purchase the tickets I was looking for. 
"I like the ease of finding the event and being able to choose what seat you want at Vivid Seats. They have a layout of the venue and you can pick and choose the seat you want. I love doing this as it helps me compare prices of seats from different areas of the venue. And it is very easy to order tickets on Vivid Seats. First you have to make an account. This helps for future uses so when you come back to the site, it has your info already for you to use. Then you search the event you want to go to. Then you look for the seats that are available and you choose what seats you want. Checkout is fairly easy especially if you have an account. They have your credit card info on file so you can pick that as a form of payment. Finally, you either download the tickets or they are mailed to you. Overall, it's fun and simple to use Vivid Seats. I find their website features more appealing than others."
"Vivid Seats is easy to find and access. They also have a very easy to use website. The prices were as good or better than other sites. The customer service is fantastic and can easily answer any questions you may have. So far, it works great. But even though their prices are fair, I and most people I know would always like and benefit from lower prices. Vivid also needs to get their branding out in public more, away from the computer or internet. This would then lead people to look them up on the computer or internet. Bonus for Vivid and more customers and sales. "
"I made an account and it was very easy to use the site, I had bought tickets for a upcoming event and it was a very simple purchase. I very much like the quick load times and the easy navigation of the site. A common issue is slow, unresponsive websites but is not a concern with this site. I would like to see what this site has to offer in the future and the changes it decides to make to its homepage. "
"When you are ready to purchase your ticket you are given an option if you want to make an account. The process is easy and not very difficult. If you have an issue there are places you can go and ask questions. Also I like it when you enter the Vivid Seats website and you don't have to put your area in. You can automatically get tickets to events that are near your location. While the experience was good, I hate the fact that there aren't much information about what is going to occur during the event. I want to know more details about the event."
