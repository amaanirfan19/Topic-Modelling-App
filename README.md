# LLM based Customer Segmentation Model

## Overview
This project implements a customer segmentation model that leverages the power of BERTopic for topic modeling and Cohere's API for generating insightful topics from customer data.

## Features
- **BERTopic**: An advanced method for extracting topics from text.
- **Cohere's API**: Utilizes LLMs to generate and refine topics.

## Features

- **Data Upload Flexibility**: Choose to upload your **own dataset** or experiment with our **curated sample data**.
- **Custom Department Segmentation**: Tailor the segmentation by selecting the **number of departments** for categorization.
- **Intelligent Topic Visualization**: Discover the main topics with a **bar chart** that combines top keywords, representative documents, and the power of a **Language Learning Model (LLM)**.
- **Interactive Data Exploration**: Engage with an **interactive plot** to scrutinize the reviews and their assigned departments.
- **Test Data Trials**: Evaluate new data and receive instant classification along with a **confidence score**.
- **Model Download & Code Snippet**: After training, download the model and use the provided **Python code snippet** to seamlessly integrate it into your workflow.

## Visualizing Success

Our platform not only segments but also brings data to life through dynamic visualizations:

## Future Work

- **LLM-Driven Customer Service Improvement**: We plan to integrate advanced **Language Learning Models (LLMs)** to analyze customer feedback and provide **detailed recommendations** for each department. This will help companies to pinpoint areas of improvement and implement targeted strategies for enhancing customer satisfaction.

- **RAG for Dynamic Knowledge Integration**: By incorporating **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, our system will dynamically pull in relevant information from a vast knowledge base to provide context-rich support and suggestions, keeping the recommendations up-to-date with the latest trends and customer expectations.
